* Following Funny or Die’s awfully received iSteve flick, another Steve Jobs biopic is slated for release later this summer. Ashton Kutcher’s jOBS film, which debuted at the Sundance festival back in January, was originally slated for a worldwide release on April 19, but got delayed. According to the latest Hollywood chatter, the movie is now set to launch on August 16 in the United States…
* According to an exclusive report by The Wrap, the movie will open against Universal’s Kick-Ass 2, Relativity’s Paranoia and the Weinstein Company’s historical drama The Butler.
* A media release confirms the news:
* Open Road Films will release JOBS – the highly anticipated film chronicling the story of Steve Jobs’ ascension from college dropout to one of the most revered creative entrepreneurs of the 20th century – nationwide on August 16, 2013.
* JOBS details the major moments and defining characters that influenced Steve Jobs on a daily basis from 1971 through 2001. The film plunges into the depths of his character, creating an intense dialogue-driven story that is as much a sweeping epic as it is an immensely personal portrait of Steve Jobs’ life. 
* The Kutcher movie is being directed by Joshua Michael Stern based on screenplay by Matt Whiteley. The movie follows Jobs, played by Kutcher from his hippie days to becoming one of the most creative entrepreneurs of our time.

* The other Steve, Steve Wozniak, is played by Josh Gad. Other stars include James Woods, Matthew Modine, Dermot Mulroney, Lukas Haas and Ahna O’Reilly.
* Five Star Institute’s Mark Hulme financed and produced the movie, which Open Road acquired in a service release deal prior to this year’s Sundance Film Festival, where “Jobs” was the closing night film. Both sides decided to wait and create proper buzz before releasing “Jobs” rather than rush the movie out so soon after Sundance.
* Hopefully, the flick will make more sense than Funny or Die’s ill-fated take.
* In addition to iSteve and Jobs, Hollywood major Sony Pictures is filming a Jobs movie written by Aaron Sorkin, adapted from Jobs’ authorized biography by Walter Isaacson.
* MacRumors says the high-profile Sony flick will contain scenes depicting Jobs backstage prior to the launches of the original Mac, the NeXT cube and the iPod.
