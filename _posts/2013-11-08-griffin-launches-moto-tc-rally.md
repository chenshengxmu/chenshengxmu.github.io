* Folks in the market for a new remote control car that you can control with an iOS device should check out Griffin’s new ‘Moto TC Rally’ offering. It’s half the price of the recently released Anki Drive kit and uses Bluetooth 4.0.
* The fact that it uses Bluetooth 4.0 is huge for a few reasons. In addition to requiring almost no power, this means that you won’t be restricted to line-of-sight, nor will you have to attach a bulky controller pack to your device…

* From Griffin:
* “This USB-rechargeable car combines real world and in-app driving excitement, using impact sensors that detect damage from other drivers and obstacles. Interact with your environment like never before! Communicate using Bluetooth, and your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch becomes your remote. That means no extra remote to lose, and no batteries to replace.”
* The Moto TC Rally has a built-in 600 mAhr 4.8v NiMH battery, which sounds pretty stout, but Griffin doesn’t say how much drive time that equates to. It’s nice that it’s rechargeable though, and that there’s no controller pack.
* As for the car itself, you can either drive it solo or against other vehicles. The app allows you to configure and balance your car’s speed and armor for your ideal setup, as well as attack other Rally drivers to inflict ‘virtual damage.’
* Here’s a clip of the car in action:
* Now I know there are a number of iOS-controlled vehicles already on the market, but this one looks particularly interesting—especially with the holidays around the corner. You can find the Moto TC Rally in Griffin’s web store for $100.
