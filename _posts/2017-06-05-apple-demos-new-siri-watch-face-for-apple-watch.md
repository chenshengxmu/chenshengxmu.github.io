* Apple announced a totally new Siri-based watch face for Apple Watch at the WWDC 2017 keynote along with two other new sets of watch faces.
* The new Siri watch face is intended to provide automatic information tailored to how you use your Apple Watch with the apps installed on it.
* As things come up throughout your day, the Siri watch face updates automatically with information related to your apps and your activities.
* It uses information like Frequent Locations and upcoming events in your Calendar or Reminders apps to provide you with an always-changing experience that updates in real-time.
* Apple also introduced a new kaleidoscope watch face, which moves as the time changes, which is a great esthetic effect for those who like seeing movement on their watch face.

* In addition to the kaleidoscope watch face, Apple announced new Toy Story-themed watch faces that join the existing Mickey Mouse watch faces, which take advantage of three characters from the popular Pixar movies: Buzz Lightyear, Woody, and Jessie.
