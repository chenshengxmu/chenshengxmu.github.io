* Folks who missed out on all of the Black Friday iPad sales will want to check out their local Best Buy today. The popular electronics retailer is currently discounting all of its iPad Air 2 models by $125, and all of its iPad mini 4 models by $100.
* The promotion is available online, and it applies to both Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular models. So for instance, you can pick up a 16GB Wi-Fi iPad Air 2 for just $375 (normally $499), or a 16GB iPad mini 4 for just $299.
* Here are a few more examples of iPad Air 2 promo pricing:

* Shipping is free, but you can also select in-store pickup depending on inventory at your local Best Buy. I wasn’t able to find an end date for the promotion, but you shouldn’t hold out too long, because some models appear to have sold out already.
