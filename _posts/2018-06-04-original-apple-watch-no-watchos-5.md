* Heads up for folks with an original (Series 0) Apple Watch. The watchOS 5 update, which Apple announced earlier today during its WWDC keynote, will not support the older hardware. Everyone else is safe though: watchOS 5 supports Series 1, 2 and 3 models.
* Version 5 of Apple’s wearable platform is a sizable update. It includes a new Competitions feature, which allows you to challenge your friends to 7-day fitness competitions, a new Walk-Talkies communications app, support for the Podcasts app, and much more.
* The original Apple Watch was first unveiled on September 9, 2014, and it wasn’t available to buy until April 2015. A device losing update support after just 3 years is uncharacteristic of Apple, and wow do we feel bad for owners of those $10K+ Edition Watches.
