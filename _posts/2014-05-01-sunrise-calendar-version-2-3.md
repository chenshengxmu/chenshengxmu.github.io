* Sunrise Calendar, which made our list of best calendar apps for iOS back in March, was updated today. The new release brings the app to version 2.3, and includes a handful of improvements as well as a new feature called ‘Interesting Calendars.’
* As the name suggests, Interesting Calendars allows you to add various types of pre-made calendars with a few simple taps. Sunrise now offers over 25,000 calendars to help you keep track of holidays, sport team schedules and more within the app…
* Here is your 2.3 change log:
* What’s New in Version 2.3
* – Today we are excited to introduce our next feature: Interesting Calendars! Sunrise now offers more than 25,000 calendars for holidays, sport teams, name days, week numbers, and more. It’s all free so you can add as many as you want. Get started in the Settings > Interesting Calendars. – We’ve also added more options for recurring events and improved our integration with Exchange calendars.
* I have to say, I really like the concept of Interesting Calendars. Of course other apps, including the stock client, support pre-made calendars like this, but the idea of being able to add the Cowboys or Mavericks game schedule in-app is far more appealing.
* Anyway, today’s update follows last month’s 2.2 release, which brought about Exchange support and other improvements. If you’re interested in checking out the app for yourself, you can find Sunrise Calendar in the App Store for iPhone and iPad, for free.
