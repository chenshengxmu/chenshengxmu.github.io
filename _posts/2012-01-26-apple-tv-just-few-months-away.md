* There’s rumors, and then there’s crazy rumors. And this one definitely falls in the latter category. The folks over at TechnoBuffalo are reporting that Apple’s TV set is much closer to launch than we previously thought.
* Citing a “high-ranking source with a major electronics retailer,” the site is claiming that the Cupertino company is looking to debut its rumored television set as early as April of this year…
* “Speaking in conditions of anonymity, the source said they’ve seen “gorgeous, very thin” pre-production versions of the set in person, and that they employ OLED panels at various sizes up to 42-inches…
* …While we don’t know if the set will be running it’s own version of iOS, we do know that it will have deep integration with devices running the popular operating system. They’ll also sport Siri style voice controls as well as facial recognition software, and plans for the TV’s voice control system are said to far exceed what’s currently in use on the iPhone 4S. And if the user opts to not use voice, an iOS device can be used as a stand in remote. Apple execs are reportedly describing the new product line as a “hub” to your life, replacing the PC as the most-used device in a consumer’s home.”
* To be fair, everything mentioned in the report is fairly plausible. OLED is the hot new TV technology on the block, as seen at CES this year, so it would make sense that Apple would use it. And the noted Siri and facial recognition features fall in line with previous rumors.
* So why are we labeling this a crazy rumor? Well every other bit of gossip we’ve heard regarding Apple’s TV set points to a late-2012, if not 2013, release. April-May of 2012 just seems far too soon. Not to mention that this entire report is based on information from an electronics retailer — think Best Buy — employee. Even if he’s “high ranking,” as TechnoBuffalo suggests, it’s hard to imagine that Apple executives would give a Best Buy employee a sneak peek at a pre-production version of its yet-to-be announced TV set.
* Don’t get us wrong, we’d love for this to be true. We’re anxious to see if Apple can do for TV what it’s done for both the smartphone and tablet industries. But all of the current evidence suggests otherwise. We’ll let you know as soon as that changes.
* What do you think? Will Apple debut a TV set in the next few months?
