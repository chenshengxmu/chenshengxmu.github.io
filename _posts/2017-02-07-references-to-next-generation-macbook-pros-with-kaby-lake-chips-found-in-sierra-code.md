* A developer-only preview of what would become the macOS Sierra 10.12.4 software update references a total of eight next-generation MacBook Pro models with the latest Kaby Lake processors from Intel. First discovered by the Apple-centric blog named Pike’s Universum, the code strings in question point to unused IDs for three motherboard identifiers. Aside from other improvements, the Kaby Lake platform enables lower power consumption while possibly bringing support for 32GB RAM.
* UPDATE: A “little birdie” told The Loop’s Dave Mark that Kaby Lake’s built-in memory controller does not support 32GB RAM out of the box. In other words, moving to Kaby Lake processors does not necessarily mean we’ll see Mac notebooks with 32GB RAM unless Apple adds a separate memory controller.
* The following strings have been identified in the Sierra code:
* These strings don’t appear to reference any desktop processors.
* Based on its discovery and the underlying data, Pike’s Universum expects the upcoming MacBook Pro models to use the following processors from Intel:
* 13″ MacBook Pro without Touch Bar:
* 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar
* 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar
* There is no GPU data defined as of yet.
* KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that Kaby Lake-focused MacBook Pro updates would enter mass production during the summer, with a new 15-inch Mac notebook model with 32GB of RAM possibly entering volume production in the early fourth quarter.
