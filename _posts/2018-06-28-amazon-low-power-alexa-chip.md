* California-based chipmaker DSP Group today confirmed it’s partnered up with Amazon on a low-power Alexa chip that’s smaller than a 10-cent coin, which third-party vendors will be able to take advantage of to embed the smart assistant in their own portable accessories.
* Highlights:
* As per Reuters, DSP’s HDClear 3-mic development kit for Alexa Voice Service features the advanced DBMD5 audio processor with HDClear voice enhancement processing technology.
* The development kit comes in form of a printed circuit board with an embedded DBMD5 audio processor, Raspberry Pi and a 3-microphone array. It includes the pre-process noise-reduction, beam-forming and acoustic echo cancellation algorithms for enhanced voice accuracy.

* It’s basically a low-power solution for developers who are eager to quickly prototype a range of Alexa-powered form factors—ranging from smart speakers and wearable devices to smart home devices and remote controls—without draining the battery.
* “If you want to add voice as a user interface to such a device, you have to have a very, very low power consumption,” CEO Ofer Elyakim told Reuters in an interview.
* Amazon is also working with a number of industry heavy-weights, including the likes of Intel, Qualcomm and Cirrus Logic, on these chips that will put Alexa inside a gadget.
* DSP’s development kit provides the following benefits:
* Future Echo devices that will incorporate these features by embedding a dedicated, low-power Alexa chip will undoubtedly put more pressure on Apple’s HomePod speaker.
* The announcement is of strategic significance because third-party vendors can now reduce development costs and shorten time to market. Due to its low power requirements and tiny footprint, the chip will play a key role in the evolution of Alexa devices.
* Juniper Research predicts that sales of voice assistant devices in the United States will grow from 450 million units in 2017 to 870 million devices in 2022.
* On a related note, Amazon today unveiled an all-new Fire HD 10 Kids Edition, its “largest and fastest kids tablet,” and unveiled a brand new Show Mode for Alexa on the Fire tablets alongside the new Show Mode charging dock for the Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 tablets.
