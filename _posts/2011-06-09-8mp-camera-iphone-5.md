* The time for Apple to announce a new iPhone at this year’s developer’s conference has come, and gone. The rumors of a delayed iPhone refresh rang true this week, as no new hardware was unveiled during the keynote.
* While we’re growing tired of these supply chain rumors, each bit of gossip helps to paint a picture of what Apple’s next generation smartphone may look like. The most recent tidbit aligns with previous suggestions that the iPhone 5 will house a better camera…
* It seems that DigiTimes has gotten word that OmniVision has just secured a significant order of 8-megapixel CMOS image sensors for the Cupertino company. In fact, the company is said to be responsible for 90% of Apple’s major sensor order for the iPhone 5.
* Who’s got the other 10%? The Taiwan-based site is reporting that Sony will be filling the rest of Apple’s order. For folks that don’t recall, Sony’s loose-lipped CEO commented earlier this year that they were building 8MP sensors for the next iPhone.
* These rumors bode well for folks hoping to see camera quality improve in the next iPhone model. They also suggest that things are running smoothly for the Mac-makers, and that their next-gen smartphone should meet their purposed fall deadline.
* While I have no complaint about the iPhone 4’s picture quality, a few extra megapixels never hurt anybody.
* What do you think? Does the next iPhone need an 8MP camera?
