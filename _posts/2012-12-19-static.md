title: Static for iPhone- your social media pulse never looked this good
---
* The App Store carries a number of free and paid apps that provide analytics for your social media accounts across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other popular services. One of my favorites is StatNut, a $99-cent download, and now a new app has arrived to rule them all.
* Dubbed Static, it dives deep into your data so you don’t have to. What the software does remarkably well is present key stats using a beautifully crafted interface to help paint an accurate picture of your social media performance…
* The blurb says:
* Just added an Instagram photo? Just published a blog post? How much traffic did you get as a result? How many new followers did you gain on Twitter? Instead of hopping back and forth between apps you can see your most important social stats from one screen.
* The initial release supports Twitter, Instagram, Google Analytics, Dribble and Github so not only can you track your social media channels, but your blog posts as well.
* Of course, all this data is readily available for free on each of the respective service’s web interface. That said, if you’ve been yearning for a more human-friendly display of your social media pulse, you should definitely give Static a try.

* Static for iPhone costs 99 cents a pop and supports the iPhone 3GS or later or third-gen iPod touch and up. The app is optimized for the iPhone 5 and requires iOS 6 or later.
* Developer Jayson Lane did a nice job and I’m hoping he’ll build on the initial release by adding more social media channels in the future, including Facebook, Klout and more.
* The interface is clean, user-friendly and easy on the eyes, which goes a long way toward illustrating your social media performance. Contrast this to a lot of similar apps that I’ve tried and found to disappoint in that regard.
* If you gave Static a try, please share your impressions down in the comments.
