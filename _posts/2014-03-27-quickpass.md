* QuickPass is a recently released jailbreak tweak that allows you to quickly disable the passcode lock on your iOS device using a handy toggle found in the stock Settings app. QuickPass is a great tool when you encounter situations where it would be easier to have no passcode on your device at all.
* I find QuickPass useful when reviewing jailbreak tweaks, especially tweaks where I’m required to respring a lot. Have a look inside for a full video walkthrough showcasing how the tweak works.
* The settings for QuickPass couldn’t be any simpler; once installed, you’ll find a lone toggle for the Passcode directly underneath the Airplane Mode toggle on the main page of the stock Settings app. Disabling this toggle will disable the passcode, and enabling the toggle will enable the passcode. Besides that one toggle, there are no other settings or options to configure with QuickPass.

* As mentioned, QuickPass is a simple tweak, but generally speaking, it’s the simple tweaks that are the best tweaks. If you like the premise of QuickPass, then venture over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where it can be had for only $0.99. If you ask me, it’s worth the price of admission if you need this sort of functionality on your device.
