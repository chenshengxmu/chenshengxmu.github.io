* The Dev Team released PwnageTool 3.1.5 just a few hours ago. In this guide and tutorial, I will show you how to use PwnageTool to jailbreak iPhone 3.1.3.
* Before we get into the details, please make sure you read this article by the Dev Team. It will explain to you what you can and cannot do. It is a very important piece of information that you should not overlook.
* If at any point in time you updated your iPhone to firmware 3.1.3, then you also updated your baseband to 05.12.01. If that’s the case, you will be able to jailbreak by downgrading to 3.1.2 first, but you will not be able to unlock.
* PwnageTool will jailbreak the following 3.1.3 devices:
* If you don’t care about unlocking, RedSn0w is still an easier and quicker way to jailbreak.
* Note that this tutorial to jailbreak iPhone 3.1.3 with PwnageTool is for Mac and Mac only. There is no Windows version of PwnageTool and they will most likely never be. If you don’t have a Mac, ask around and see if a friend of yours can help you out and create a custom firmware for.
* Again, please make sure you read the information given by the Dev Team. It will answer most questions you may have.
* Step 1: Make sure you have the latest version of iTunes installed on your computer. If not, download and install it, then reboot your computer. Now make sure you backup your iPhone by syncing with iTunes, just in case something goes wrong.
* Step 2: Download PwnageTool 3.1.5 and your iPhone firmware from our downloads page. Save these 2 files to your desktop.
* Step 3: Launch PwnageTool. It should give you a warning message. Click OK.
* Step 4: Select “Expert Mode”.
* Step 5: Select your device then click the blue arrow to continue.
* Step 6: If PwnageTool doesn’t automatically find the correct IPSW file, click “Browse for IPSW” and locate it (it should be on your desktop).
* Step 7: You will now have several options. Choose “General” and click the blue arrow to continue.
* Step 8: Under “General Settings”, you have the option to activate the phone or not. This is a very important step so please read carefully.
* If you have a contract with an official carrier (such as AT&T in the US, or Orange in France, etc…), do not activate.
* If you do not have a contract with an official carrier (ie. you want to unlock for another carrier), you have to activate. Then you will have to install UltraSn0w or BlackSn0w from Cydia in order to fully unlock the phone.
* You will know you didn’t choose the right option if you don’t have signal after jailbreaking.
* You don’t have to, but I suggest increasing the root partition size to somewhere around 700MB, just to be on the safe side. When you’re done, click the blue arrow to continue.
* Step 9: You are now taken to the “Bootneuter settings”. All of them should be greyed out. Click the blue arrow to continue.
* Step 10: You are now taken to the “Cydia settings”. From here, you may download packages so you don’t have to manually do it later. For example, you may download WinterBoard, which would be installed during the pwnage process. Let’s keep things simple and skip this step which is not necessary. Click the blue arrow to continue.
* Step 10: You are now taken to the “Custom packages settings”. Make sure “Cydia” is selected.
* Step 11: You are now taken to the”Custom logos settings”. You can choose to add the default logos (see below) or you can add your own logos. If you choose to add your own, make sure the images are not larger than 320 x 480.
* Step 12: We’re almost done! You now have to build the custom IPSW. Click “Build” and click the blue arrow to continue.
* Step 13: Save your custom IPSW to your desktop.
* Step 14: PwnageTool will now start building your custom IPSW. Be patient… It can take up to 15 minutes.
* Step 15: PwnageTool will ask you if your iPhone has been pwned before. If you’re not sure, just click NO.
* Step 16: If your iPhone was previously jailbroken, you can skip to step 19. If your iPhone wasn’t already jailbroken, follow the following directions. If your iPhone isn’t plugged to your computer yet, plug it. Don’t open iTunes. If iTunes launches automatically, close it. PwnageTool will now deliver the payload.
* Step 17: After successfully delivering the payload, PwnageTool will put your iPhone in recovery mode. Click OK.
* Step 18: iTunes should pop up saying it has detected an iPhone in recovery mode and that you must restore. Click OK.
* Step 19: We are going to restore your iPhone using the custom IPSW you built. In iTunes, hold the “Alt/Option” key and click “Restore” at the same time. DO NOT click “Restore” without holding the “Alt/Option” key! A dialog box will pop up and you’ll be able to choose the custom IPSW file you created that was saved to your desktop.
* Step 20: Navigate to the “jailbreak” folder and select the custom IPSW we created.
* Step 21: iTunes will now restore your iPhone using the custom firmware which could take a while, so relax. When done, your iPhone will reboot and you will now have a jailbroken iPhone.
* That’s it! Your iPhone 3.1.3 should be fully jailbroken, thanks to the good work of the Dev Team and PwnageTool.
* In the future, make sure you do not update your iPhone firmware when there is a new one coming out. It will avoid many issues. Besides, these updates are very minor and useless. For what it’s worth, I’m still on iPhone OS 3.0, and happy to be.
* If you have any question or comment, please leave a comment.
