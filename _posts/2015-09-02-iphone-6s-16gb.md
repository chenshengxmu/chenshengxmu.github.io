* Revered gadget leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer recently published a photo of claimed iPhone 6s packaging which suggests that Apple’s upcoming iPhones will continue to offer just sixteen gigabytes of storage in baseline models.
* A new report Wednesday by 9to5Mac’s well-connected Mark Gurman reaffirms claims that Apple won’t be ditching the 16-gigabyte tier.
* Moreover, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus should have unchanged on-contract pricing as the 2014 models: $199/$299/$399 for the 16/64/128GB iPhone 6s and $299/$399/$499 for the 16/64/128GB iPhone 6s Plus.
* Moreover, the report reiterates earlier rumors that the new phones will use a stronger 7000 Series aluminum used for the Apple Watch Sport chassis, as opposed to the current iPhone 6’s 6000 Series aluminum body.
* Author Mark Gurman gleaned from sources that a few new Apple Watch Sport band colors will launch during Apple’s media presentation next Wednesday, September 9.
* “The new colors could be the same as or similar to the wider variety of sport bands Apple’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive showed to small audiences at private Apple Watch events earlier this year,” Gurman speculates.
* Baseline iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models with sixteen gigabytes of storage will no doubt dissapoint fans who have been holding their breath for thirty-two gigabytes as a new baseline tier.
* Although iOS 9 includes so-called App Thinning technologies that optimize app binaries to a user’s target device and support on-demand downloading of in-app content (i.e. additional level in games) via the App Store, sixteen gigabytes won’t be enough to store 4K footage that the new iPhones’ improved back shooter is thought to support.
* As for the pricing, I’ll be watching with great intent as Tim Cook puts up the pricing slide because major U.S. carriers like AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile have either killed, or will soon ditch subsidized smartphones in favor of selling devices at full prices through zero-interest monthly installments.
