* There wasn’t an organized public memorial for Steve Jobs, which seemed only right given his secluded lifestyle. But fans still found a way to honor him, turning out by the thousands at Apple Stores around the world to pay their respects.
* Apple has come up with a way to pay tribute to its fallen leader. On October 19, the Cupertino company is hosting an employee-only event to celebrate the life and achievements of its founder. And it looks like everyone at Apple will be participating…
* The celebration is scheduled for 10 a.m. in an outdoor amphitheater on Apple’s campus. Perhaps most interesting is that 9to5Mac is reporting that Apple’s retail stores across the globe will also be included, watching a live webcast of the memorial.
* “Now, we’re hearing that Apple Stores will be closing for one hour (1-2 EST, 10-11 PST) on that Wednesday in memory of Steve Jobs. Apple Store employees will use that one hour to view a live webcast of the Cupertino-based celebration.”
* In this day in age, as CEOs seemingly change on an annual basis, Steve Jobs and his leadership will be greatly missed. I don’t know if we’ll ever see this kind of aftereffect following a CEO’s passing again in our lifetime, and that alone speaks volumes.
