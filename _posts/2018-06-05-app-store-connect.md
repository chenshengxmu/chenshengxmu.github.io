title: The App Store Connect app lets developers respond to reviews on the go
---
* Apple’s registered developers must manage their App Store apps using the clunky iTunes Connect web app. While iTunes Connect isn’t going anywhere yet, developers now have a dedicated iPhone and iPad app to monitor stats and respond to user reviews on App Store.

* It’s called App Store Connect.
* The developer-only app can be used to monitor sales trends, receive alerts from user reviews, as well as respond to customer reviews immediately from an iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
* A developer can easily view reviews from all territories, and respond to them using their pocket computer. Previously, they would have to find a computer and load the iTunes Connect website to make any change. Adding custom sales reports is unsupported at the moment.
* The app requires a developer account and iOS 11.3 to use.
* Keep in mind that the App Store Connect app does not replace Apple’s existing iTunes Connect app for iOS, which lets app and iTune Store media providers see their sales trends and access the media items they have made available for download from Apple’s content stores.
* Download App Store Connect for free via App Store.
* Thanks, John!
