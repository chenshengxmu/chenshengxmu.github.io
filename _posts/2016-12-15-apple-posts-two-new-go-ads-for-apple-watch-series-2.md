* “Go” concept of latest Apple Watch ads has worked out well for Apple because the company just posted a pair of new commercials for Apple Watch Series 2 on its YouTube channel. Titled “Go Ride” and “Go Surf,” the 30-second videos highlight water resistance and position the wrist-worn device as the perfect companion for cyclists and surfers. Check them out and let us know how you liked them.
* “Catch a workout with every wave,” reads the video’s description.
