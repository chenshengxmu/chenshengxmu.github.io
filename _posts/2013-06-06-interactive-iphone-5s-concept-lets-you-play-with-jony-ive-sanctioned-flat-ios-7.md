* With WWDC 2013 almost upon us (five days left), the future of iOS and OS X is all but revealed. Of course, we can’t tell for sure what’s in store until Tim Cook takes the stage next Monday, but that’s not stopping creative minds from churning out new concepts on a daily basis.
* As we’ve gotten a bit fed up with static images, we were pleased to stumble upon a cool-looking iPhone 5S concept that incorporates a Jony Ive-fied flattened iOS 7 mockups.
* What sets this one apart is interactivity. This concept is basically a web app that lets you interact with the handset and check out the revamped stock iOS apps. Per usual, you should take it with a grain of salt as it’s based on what the rumor mill thinks it’s learned thus far about Apple’s major redesign…
* After waking up the handset by hitting either the Power or Home button, you should check out the new Lock screen widgets by clicking the current time at the top. This brings up a handy panel where you can access oft-used settings, the stuff like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Airplane mode and Location services.

* 9to5Mac recently reported that Apple is testing a “dedicated, easily-accessible panel for WiFi, Airplane Mode, and Bluetooth toggles.”
* As for the new-look Lock screen, Recombu explains:
* The lock screen still has a familiar appearance but there are some obvious new tweaks. The glossy, gradated look and feel has been replaced by a higher contrast UI which utilizes solid black as its main component.
* The circular lock icon and slide bar replace the traditional animated ‘slide to unlock’ element, whilst quick access to connectivity shortcuts is now available.
* You can also change the handset color (the next iPhone is said to be colorized), click the status bar to reveal a new notifications menu and browse the iOS 7 app concepts by clicking their icons.

* I don’t think iOS 7 will resemble any of these renderings.
* That’s not saying we shouldn’t dream about the redesign and try to imagine what Apple’s first iOS redesign since the iPhone’s 2007 inception might look like.
* For those wondering, the concept has been built from the ground up using only HTML, CSS and Javascript – without using a single image. Instead, they built the iPhone 5S image, as well as icon and app graphics, solely out of CSS and HTML code.
* Indeed, try changing the windows size and marvel at how the entire mockup resizes itself accordingly.
* Coolio!
