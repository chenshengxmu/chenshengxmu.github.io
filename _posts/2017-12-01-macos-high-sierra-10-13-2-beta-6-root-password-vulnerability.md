* As expected, a sixth beta of macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 that was seeded today packs in a fix for the dangerous root password vulnerability that yesterday’s emergency update has already patched on Mac computers running the commercial macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 version.
* As Apple’s emergency security update did not squash this bug in macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 beta 5 and earlier, they’ve now included it in beta 6 of the forthcoming software update.
* MacRumors has confirmed that the vulnerability is no longer functional in beta 6.
* When macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 releases later this month, people upgrading from older macOS versions will be safe knowing that their Mac won’t suffer from this dangerous bug.
* If you’re Apple’s registered developer or a public beta tester enrolled in Apple Beta Software Program, you’re recommended to update your previous installation of the macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 beta to beta 6 in order to increase the security of your Mac.
