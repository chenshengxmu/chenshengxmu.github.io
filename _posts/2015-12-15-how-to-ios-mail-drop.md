* Announced at WWDC 2014, Mail Drop made its debut on the Mac with the OS X 10.10 Yosemite software update. Starting with the iOS 9.2 software update, Mail Drop is now finally available through Apple’s stock Mail app on the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
* Addressing one of the fundamental problems with email today, Mail Drop makes it easy to share large files by permitting Mail app users to send emails with encrypted attachments up to 5GB in size.
* In this tutorial, you will learn how easy it is to send large attachments in Mail for iOS with the Mail Drop feature.
* Mail Drop works with a Mac using OS X Yosemite or later, an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 9.2, and a Mac or PC with an updated browser. To learn about sending large attachments with Mail Drop on the Mac, check out Jeff’s tutorial.
* Step 1: Launch Mail on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.

* Step 3: In the message body, tap and hold to bring up the bubble interface. Choose Insert Photo or Video from the menu (tap the arrows to scroll through options).

* “These attachments may be too large to send by email,” reads the prompt. If you wish to use Mail Drop to send the attachments, choose the Use Mail Drop option.
* You recipient will receive an email with tappable download links. They can hit the links to download individual attachments, or choose Download Attachments at the top of the message to save all Mail Drop attachments from iCloud at once.

* Tapping the cloud prompts Mail to retrieve the linked files from iCloud, display the images and videos inline and save them to the Camera roll.
* Recipients that use Apple’s Mail app on macOS, iOS and on iCloud.com will see previews of image attachments in the message and can download full-resolution images.
* For other kinds of attachments or email apps, recipients see a download link. The time it takes to upload or download an attachment can vary depending on the speed of your Internet connection and the size of your attachment.
* Sent Mail Drop attachments are available on iCloud for the next 30 days and cannot be deleted manually. Uncompressed folders cannot be attached via Mail Drop.
* The recipients might not be able to access your attachment if the link has an excessive amount of downloads or high traffic.
* Apple’s support document details other Mail Drop limitations.
