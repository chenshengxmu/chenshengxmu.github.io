* During its big Galaxy Note 5/S6 Edge+ event last week, Samsung showed off a video teaser of its upcoming Apple Watch competitor, the Gear S2. For folks who missed the keynote, the clip is now available on the company’s Mobile YouTube channel.
* We can glean quite a bit from the video. The Gear S2 will have a round watch face, similar to the Moto 360 and the LG G Watch R, with round icons and other UI elements to match. It also looks like it will feature heart rate and fitness tracking capabilities.

* Additionally, it’s being reported that the Gear S2 will run on Samsung’s proprietary Tizen operating system, instead of Android Wear. If true, this would block users from accessing the plethora of apps and watch faces already available for Google’s wearable OS.
* Little else is known about the Gear S2, other than that Samsung will reveal more at its IFA press event next month. The company has of course been making wearables for years now, but it’ll be interesting to see what its first post-Apple Watch offering looks like.
