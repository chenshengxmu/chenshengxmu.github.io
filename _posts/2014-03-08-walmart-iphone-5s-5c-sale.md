* Not to be outdone by Best Buy, Walmart has launched a new iPhone promotion this week. The national retailer can now beat the electronics dealer in price on the entry level models of both the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c by up to $30.
* The sale knocks the 16GB iPhone 5s down to $119, and its 5c counterpart down to just $29. Obviously, both of these prices require that you sign a two-year contract with a carrier, but otherwise there are no gift card or trade-in stipulations…
* CNN Money reports:
* “Wal-Mart announced price cuts Wednesday on the Samsung Galaxy S4, as well as for Apple’s 16-gigabyte iPhone 5s and 5c, for customers signing two-year contracts withAT&T (T, Fortune 500) and Verizon (VZ, Fortune 500).
* A Galaxy S4 with a two-year contract is now $49, down from $99. The 16-gigabyte 5s is dropping from $145 to $119, while the 5c is now $29, down from $45. In addition, customers who purchase any Samsung phone with a two-year contract between March 9 and March 22 will receive a free $50 Wal-Mart gift card.”
* The outlet believes the promo will fuel speculation that Apple plans to release a new iPhone sooner than its usual fall timeframe—a popular theory this year. But the reality is Apple has little to do with carrier/third-party retailer pricing.
* Anyway, for those that can’t or don’t want to go to Walmart, Best Buy is currently offering the 16GB iPhone 5s for $150 and the 16GB 5c for $50. There’s no word on how long these prices are good for though, so make sure you act quickly.
