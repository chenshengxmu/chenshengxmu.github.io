* Back in January, the NFL said it will be rolling out an all-new NFL Now service this summer and now a new rumor Monday morning alleged that launch is imminent. Moreover, NFL Now should launch in time for the new season as a channel on the $99 Apple TV box, too.
* Announced back in January, NFL Now is a personalized on-demand video service for sports fans that delivers a steady stream of original content such as news broadcasts, features, highlights, extensive archives, live streams of press events and more.
* The service will be launching across multiple platforms ahead of the 2014-2105 NFL season, which kicks off later in August…
* The image top of post depicts the forthcoming NFL Now app for the Apple TV, as taken by an NFL employee. The app is currently undergoing testing.
* In a nutshell, NFL Now sports a mix of content from the very best of NFL Media, NFL clubs and NFL Films.
* Key highlights, from NFL’s press release:
* The football-focused Apple TV channel should debut later this month.
* A brand new iPhone and iPad app is set to follow soon after. NFL Now will launch across multiple platforms, including on the web and on media-streaming devices and gaming consoles such as the Roku and Microsoft Xbox 360.
* Here’s NFL’s promotional video for the service.
* A word of caution: NFL Now won’t be live-streaming actual games and there won’t be NFL Sunday Ticket on Apple’s box.
* Who’s looking forward to watching NFL action on their Apple TV?
