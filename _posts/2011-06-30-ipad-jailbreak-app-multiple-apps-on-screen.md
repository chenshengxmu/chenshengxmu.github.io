* Don’t you just hate running iPhone-only apps on your large iPad screen? When you enlarge them they look all pixelated and ugly, but when you keep them at normal size, much of the iPad’s screen goes to waste.
* Your disdain for iPhone-only apps might soon change if this jailbreak app in development ever sees the light of day.
* We’re assuming the tentative name of the app is Polyonix judging from the screenshot, and it allows you to run multiple iPhone apps on your iPad’s screen at the same time…
* The only visual we have thus far is a screenshot posted on the developer’s blog. The screen shows Angry Birds running side-by-side with another instance of itself; it almost looks Nintendo DS-ish.
* Per developer Aaron Ash’s Blog:
* Yes, and it actually works! I’ve wasted plenty of time already playing 2 games of Angry Birds at the same time. (I actually was playing 3 for a while, but it crashed when I tried to add a 4th). There are a few bugs, such as audio not working, and accelerometer events not getting sent to applications; it may take a while to sort these out.
* I’m excited to see this app come to fruition. It obviously works, so I think it’s only a matter of time before we see it on Cydia.
* What about you? Do you think it looks promising?
