* Apple today released a second beta of an upcoming iOS 10.1 software update and a third beta of an upcoming macOS Sierra 10.12.1 software update to non-developers who are enrolled in the official Apple Beta Software Program.
* Both macOS Sierra and iOS 10.1 public betas can be downloaded over-the-air through Apple’s Software Update mechanism on devices enrolled in the beta program. iOS devices must have the proper certificate installed to run public betas.
* iOS 10.1 includes a beta of Portrait mode in the stock Camera app for taking depth of field photographs with the bokeh effect on the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus devices. There’s also a brand new switch in Settings that allows you to turn on the Reduce Motion feature without disabling bubble and screen animations in Messages.
* iOS 10.1 beta 2 was seeded yesterday to Apple’s registered developers.
* macOS Sierra beta 3 was pushed to developers on Monday.
* When it releases for public consumption, macOS Sierra 10.12.1 will bring support for a dedicated Portrait album in the stock Photos app. The Portrait album is where any bokeh images taken with the iPhone 7 Plus’s dual-lens camera will be stored.
