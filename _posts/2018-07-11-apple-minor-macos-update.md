title: Apple releases a minor macOS Mojave beta 3 update fixing Feedback Assistant crashes
---
* On Wednesday, developers received an update to the third beta of macOS 10.14 Mojave. The update comes just days after the public release of macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra, and a few days after macOS Mojave beta 3 arrived.

* Not surprisingly, this is a minor update with build numbers changing by a single character. Last week’s release was marked as 18A326g while the one today is 18A326h.
* Apple’s expected to release macOS Mojave to the public this fall alongside new versions of iOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
