* With today’s release of iOS 7.1 beta 3, many people feared that exploits used in the evasi0n7 jailbreak would be patched. As it appears, and even though evasi0n7 cannot jailbreak iOS 7.1 beta 3 as is, Apple didn’t patch evasi0n7.
* Although official members of the evad3rs still have to talk about it, the news has been confirmed by hacker iH8sn0w in a recent tweet…
* From what we hear, there is even an unofficial updated version of evasi0n7 making the rounds online, apparently developed by a team of Russian hackers. We don’t really know much more at this time, but I believe Jeff is currently trying out this unsanctioned version of evasi0n7 on a test device. You may want to check back iDB later for more details on that.
* Even though iOS 7.1 beta 3 doesn’t patch evasi0n7, it’s hard to believe that the software will make it out to the general public in this state. As always, time will tell.
