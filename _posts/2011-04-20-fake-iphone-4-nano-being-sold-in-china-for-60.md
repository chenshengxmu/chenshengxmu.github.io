* With rumors flying about the iPhone 5, little attention has been paid to the iPhone Nano rumors that surfaced months ago. While the U.S. has remained quiet about a future iPhone Nano device, Chinese dealers are beginning to sell knock-off iPhone 4 Nano’s to the tune of about $60 U.S.
* These fake, mini iPhone devices run a Java-based iOS ripoff and behave a lot like the original iPhone. Most notably, these Chinese knock-offs are about 2/3 the size of the real iPhone 4…

* A Giz-China writer stumbled upon a dealer selling these fake iPhone Nano devices off-contract for about $60. He described the device as being small enough to fit inside the palm of his hand.
* These fake iPhone Nanos sport a 1.3 megapixel rear-facing camera, and allegedly have a front-facing camera as well. Giz-China didn’t get to try the front-facing camera.

* Although the device’s operating system distinctly resembled iOS, it was obvious that the fake iPhone in question was running a Java-based knock-off of Apple’s iOS. Giz-China didn’t get an extensive hands-on with the device, but they did provide some helpful insight into the fake iPhone market.
* Devices like this remind us of the Sophone knock-off, but this fake iPhone Nano lacks the specs needed to make it a worthy iPhone competitor. The only thing it has going for it is price.
* What do you think about this fake iPhone Nano? Apple probably has something much cooler up its sleeve.
