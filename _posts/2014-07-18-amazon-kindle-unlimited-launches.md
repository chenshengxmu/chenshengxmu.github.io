* As suspected, Amazon today formally introduced its brand new all-you-can-eat e-book plan, Kindle Unlimited.
* Priced at $9.99 per month, the iOS-compatible service gives reading aficionados unlimited access to more than 600,000 books, including best-selling titles like the Harry Potter series, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Hunger Games trilogy and Diary of a Wimpy Kid books.
* The subscription plan is available on Kindle devices, as well as free Kindle reading apps for iOS, Android and more…
* According to Amazon, the plan also includes more than 2,000 audiobooks, including titles like The Handmaid’s Tale, Life of Pi and Capital in the Twenty-First Century.
* Kindle Unlimited includes other popular features such as Whispersync, X-ray and Goodreads integration, Kindle-exclusive books, thousands of “short reads” (titles that are 100 pages or less), to name a few.
* A free 30-day trial is available, too.
* Additionally, Amazon will treat Kindle Unlimited subscribers to free access to Audible’s library with more than 150,000 audiobook titles available for 3-months, regularly a $14.95 value.

* So what’s the difference between Kindle Unlimited and Kindle Owner’s Lending Library available to Amazon’s $99 per year Prime subscribers?
* First, though both offer largely the same e-book library, Kindle Unlimited brings those books to devices like the iPad.
* Second, Kindle Unlimited does not limit you in terms of borrowing periods or number of titles read per month.
* And third, Kindle Unlimited is a standalone service which not only offers unlimited reading, but also audiobooks.
* Check out Amazon’s promo video.
* Kindle Unlimited features include:
* The service is currently available in the United States only. If you’re interested, check out Kindle Unlimited at the Amazon website.
* Will you be subscribing to Kindle Unlimited?
* I think the service offers fair value, especially for those who plan on reading more than one e-book per month.
* With e-books typically selling for about ten dollars a pop, this is similar to the argument that Spotify offers unlimited access to streaming music for the price of a single album download on iTunes or less.
