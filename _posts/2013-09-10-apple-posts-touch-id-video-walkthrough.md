* Just like clockwork, Apple has now updated its website with new material related to today’s announcements. The flagship iPhone 5s has received a substantial upgrade and with much of the attention surrounding its fingerprint scanning feature, the company has made a little video explaining how they integrated the sensitive fingerprint reader into the Home button while giving us an overview of how Touch ID works. I’ve included it for your viewing pleaser right after the break, have a look right now…
* Apple SVP of Design, Jonathan Ive, and SVP of Hardware Engineering, Dan Riccio, will take it from here.
