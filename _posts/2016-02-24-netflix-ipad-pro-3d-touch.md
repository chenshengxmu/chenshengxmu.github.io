* Netflix on Wednesday pushed out an update for its iOS client, bringing the app to version 8.0. The release is significant in that it features a number of improvements, including a better Kids experience on iPad and new Post-Play experience on iPhone.
* Version 8.0 also features native support for Apple’s just released iPad Pro, meaning the layout has been optimized for the tablet’s 12.9-inch screen to show more content per screen, as well as support for 3D Touch actions like Peek and Pop within the app.
* What’s New in Version 8.0.0
* You can download Netflix from the App Store for free, but you’ll have to pay $10 per month for the service.
