* The last time I saw that many tweaks released during a single week probably was months ago. It’s fair to say things have been pretty quiet on the jailbreak side for a while, so it’s definitely refreshing to see such a busy week.
* None of these tweaks will change your life, but they will certainly make your iOS experience that much enjoyable. After all, isn’t that one of the reasons we jailbreak in the first place?
* Aeuria LS: a beautiful time-focused design for the Lock screen (free – feature)
* AppRunByActivator: automatically runs an app when you enter the device’s passcode ($0.99)
* BlurryLaunch: adds a subtle blurry effect when launching an app (free)
* CertManager: allows users to define the SSL certificates they trust (free)
* CustomNotificationSound: lets you customize the sound of third-party apps notifications (free – feature)
* DeLe: lets you delay messages before sending them, and also offers several Messages-related tools ($2.99)
* DoNotDisturb Silence Flipswitch: the name of this add-on says it all (free)

* RippleBoard: adds ripple effects to the iOS Home screen (free – feature)
* SilkScreen: an easy way to share screenshots taken in Safari app (free)
* Sim&Puk Attempt: lets you increase the amount of SIM or PUK input attempts before locking the device (free)
* StopAutoDelete: stops the iOS cursor from deleting entire words (free – feature)
