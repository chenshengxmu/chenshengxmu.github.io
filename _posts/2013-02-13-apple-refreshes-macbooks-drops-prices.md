* Apple Wednesday morning announced it has refreshed Retina MacBook Pro and MacBook Air configurations with faster processors and lower price points. The 256GB 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display is now a $300 cheaper and has an upgraded processor and its entry-level 128GB counterpart now costs $200 less. Two 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros have also received a slight specs bump up. The MacBook Air is now a $100 cheaper. Full details right after the break…
* According to a media release, the 13-inch 256GB MacBook Pro with Retina display has been enhanced with a 2.6GHz quad-core chip, an increase from 2.5GHz, and is now priced at $1,699, down from $1,999 for a cool $300 saving.
* The entry-level 128GB model now costs $1,499, down from $1,699 for a $200 saving.
* Apple has updated the MacBook Pro twice since the last MacBook Air update

* The entry-level 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display now sports a faster 2.4GHz quad-core chip, up from 2.3GHz. The high-end 15-incher now has a 2.7GHz processor with 16GB of RAM (previously 2.6GHz).
* So, 13” Retina is now $100 more than a 13” Air (with less storage). Smart pricing.

* Prices of both 15-inch Retina notebooks remain the same as before.
* As for the MacBook Air, the 13-inch model with 256 gigabytes of flash storage is now priced at $1,399, down from $1,499 for a $100 saving.
* According to MacRumors, the top-of-the-line non-Retina 15-inch MacBook is no more, leaving only the base model starting at $1799.
* Customers can still configure the low-end model with all available options, meaning that the previous high-end configuration is still available, but it is no longer being promoted separately as a stock machine.
* Apple said that the new refreshed computers are available starting today via its online store. The US online store wasn’t updated with the new prices at the time of this writing.
* Additionally, people who’ve purchased a Mac notebook in the past two weeks can exchange it for one of the new models, free of charge.
