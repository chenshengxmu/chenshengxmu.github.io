* No more workarounds needed to enjoy Emoji icons on your iPhone with iOS 5. This feature is now completely integrated in Apple’s latest OS and can be activated in just a few simple steps.
* To activate Emoji in iOS 5, go to Settings > General > Keyboard > International Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > Emoji. Once turned on, you can easily switch between your primary keyboard and the Emoji keyboard by hitting the “globe” icon on your keyboard…
* Remember that Emoji are not cross platform. If you send them to someone, make sure they run iOS or else, they will see weird little error icons.
