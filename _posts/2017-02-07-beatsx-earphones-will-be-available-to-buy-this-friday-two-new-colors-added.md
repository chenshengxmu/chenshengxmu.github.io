* Corroborating yesterday’s report, CNET today said that the upcoming BeatsX earphones with the Apple W1 wireless chip and a new neckband design will be launching this Friday, February 10, in the United States. The earbuds will be available to purchase from Apple.com and company-owned retail stores. Aside from the existing Black and White color options, CNET has learned that the $150 accessory will be available in two additional finishes, Gray and Blue, following this Friday’s launch.
* BeatsX feature a new neckband design with a flexible cord and magnets that prevent the earbuds from flying around when not in use. The earphones use Apple’s W1 wireless chip for reliable Bluetooth connections and crisp digital sound.
* Apple’s wireless accessories like AirPods, PowerBeats3 and Beats Solo3 also integrate the W1 chip, but BeatsX, when they arrive this Friday, will officially become the most affordable W1-outfitted earphones on the market.
