* Apple yesterday pushed the first update to Clips for iPhone and iPad following the software’s debut on App Store nearly a month ago. Bumped to version 1.0.1, Clips packs in improvements to the Live Title feature that lets you create animated captions and titles in 36 different languages using your voice.
* Apple says you can now tap on Live Title text while playing or paused to edit it manually in case Siri misheard you. Additionally, when you share your edited video to a contact who has multiple messaging addresses in your address book, the app will now suggest the most frequently used address.
* Lastly, the stability and reliability when capturing and sharing videos that contain certain posters have been improved in this edition of the app.

* The app requires iOS 10.3 or later and does not work on 32-bit devices.
