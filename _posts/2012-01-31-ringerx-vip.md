* Don’t you just hate it when you miss an important call because you forgot to turn your iPhone’s mute switch off? Or what about that one annoying person that always calls at 3 in the morning? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could forever silence their calls?
* With RingerX VIP, all of these scenarios feature easy solutions.
* This is a jailbreak tweak for those who require fine grained control over how various contacts are treated whenever they call you or message you…
* RingerX VIP allows you to customize each individual contact with specific ringtone and vibrate settings for both SMS messages and phone calls. Options like always silent, ignore mute, custom volumes, and always vibrate permeate the tweak’s settings. There’s even an option to customize the ringtone of a contact when you’ve set it to ignore the mute switch.
* To make things easy, there’s a built in feature that allows you to toggle RingerX VIP off on an individual basis, along with a full fledged global kill switch in the Settings app.
* For those of you who are interested in temporary mute options, those too can be enabled using a simple Activator action. The custom mute can range anywhere from 5 minutes to 23 hours and 55 minutes. The temporary mute is perfect for meetings, or movies; I think 23 hours is long enough even for a rerun of Titanic don’t you think?
* To top everything off, the developer went above and beyond to create some comprehensive documentation for the tweak; not since CallBar (and yes RingerX VIP works with CallBar) have we seen such in-depth help guides.
* RingerX VIP will be available in Cydia’s BigBoss repo in just a few days for $1.99. In the meantime, why not share some of the ways this tweak would be beneficial to you?
