* I’m not going to say that I told you so, but you know, I kinda did. One of BGR‘s sources at Apple shared some interesting numbers about Verizon iPhone sales on its first week, and apparently, the numbers are lower than both Apple and Verizon anticipated.
* If that’s any indication of the sales trend, BGR’s source states that there were about 550,000 iPhone 4 pre-ordered between Verizon and Apple and maybe even more interesting are the sales numbers for 5 Apple Store combined on the first week, including 2 major stores (most likely including the iconic Apple Store on Fifth avenue)…
* That ain’t much, especially when you know these are the sales of 5 stores combined.
* Someone at AT&T is smiling looking at these numbers.
