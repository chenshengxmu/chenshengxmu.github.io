* Good news for folks looking to grab an iPhone on the cheap before Christmas. T-Mobile is reviving its Black Friday special for a limited time, taking away the down payments for select iPhone models making them completely free up front.
* The promotion starts December 11—that’s today—and includes 16GB models of the iPhone 5s and 5c, along with other devices. This means that, if you qualify, you wouldn’t have to pay for either phone until you got your first monthly bill…
* Here’s the announcement from T-Mobile:
* “T-Mobile continues to spread holiday cheer with our most affordable out of pocket prices on wireless devices. Starting December 11, T-Mobile is dropping the upfront price of some of the most popular iPhones® to $0 down for well-qualified new and existing customers. This limited-time offer includes the 16GB models of iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. iPad Air, iPad mini and iPad mini with Retina display are also currently priced at $0 down for well-qualified new and existing customers.
* Customers can get iPhone 5s in the 16GB model for $0 down with 24 equal monthly payments of $27, with a no annual service contract Simple Choice Plan. Customers can get iPhone 5c in the 16GB model for $0 down with 24 equal monthly payments of $22.91.”
* Interestingly enough, the carrier is also including iPads. So if you’re looking at an iPad Air, iPad mini or iPad mini with Retina display (16GB, LTE version), you can pick one up for $0 down and 24 payments of $26.25, $17.91, or $22.08 respectively.
* Keep in mind that T-Mobile says the promotion is only for ‘well-qualified’ individuals, so that probably means a credit check and other restrictions will apply. But those that qualify could pick up some sweet gifts without spending any money right now.
* T-Mobile is currently the fourth largest carrier in the US and has LTE coverage 40 of the top 50 markets.
