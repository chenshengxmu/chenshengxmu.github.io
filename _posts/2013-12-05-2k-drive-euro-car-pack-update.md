* 2K Games in co-operation with Lucid Games released its iOS racing game on the App Store, 2K Drive, back in September. Featuring a number of real world vehicles, more than 25 tracks, over a hundred unique events and impressive graphics and gameplay, 2K Drive arrived as a nice alternative to Electronic Arts’ Real Racing 3 and other racing titles available on Apple’s platform.
* In today’s major Euro Car Pack content update, 2K Games has added five new cars to 2K Drive for iPhone and iPad, including the Mercedes-Benz vehicles, as well as new events…
* The five new cars included in this update are as follows: Mercedes-Benz C 63 AMG Coupe Black Series, Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Electric Drive, McLaren MP4-12C GT3, McLaren F1 and Land Rover Defender.
* Additionally, 2K Drive version 1.7 also comes with minor bug fixes and offers new events “to keep you driving for hours”.
* Here’s the original 2K Drive announcement trailer.
* This update is free if you already own 2K Drive.
* 2K Drive costs seven bucks in the App Store.
* The 712MB universal app is compatible with the iPhone 4 and up and enhanced for later devices such as the iPad Air and the iPhone 5s.
