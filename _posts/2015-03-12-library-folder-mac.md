* By default, the ~/Library folder is hidden on Mac. This is a folder that Apple feels you shouldn’t need access to most of the the time, but occasionally, you may need it for specific things. I use it often to view the preferences for the apps I have installed on my Mac. I also use it to access the Application Support folder, which as its name alludes to, features supporting files for apps.
