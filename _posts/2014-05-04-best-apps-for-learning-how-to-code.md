* These days, kids in elementary school are already learning how to code. It can be really intimidating for someone who doesn’t even know what HTML is. Even though computer knowledge is much better for the average person than it was 20 years ago, there are still a lot of secrets hidden behind those cool programs we use.
* If you are too old to have learned code in school, too young to have started yet, or just want to practice the basics you learned so long ago you’ve forgotten, we’ve got a list of some of the best apps to learn how to code…

* Last May, I took a look at the early version of this code learning game. Although I found it to be extremely exciting to learn code using giant robots, I also found it to be excruciatingly irritating to try to play a game that was infested with bugs. Thankfully, the game received a complete overhaul (and name) and is much less buggy. Learn to code by giving movement inputs to your robot. Don’t worry, you will be told what to do and learn what you did wrong. This game is available for free.

* The best way to get your kids excited about computers is to start them with the learning process early. No, wait. That’s the best way to ensure they will hate it. Just like piano lessons.

This app will teach your tiny tot about control-flow concepts like procedures, loops, and conditionals. They will never know you hid cauliflower in their mashed potatoes.
