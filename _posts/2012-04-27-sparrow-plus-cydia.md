title: Sparrow Plus now available on Cydia
---
* Sparrow+ — the jailbreak tweak that allows you to set Sparrow as the iPhone’s default mail client, along with enabling push notifications — is now available on Cydia.
* Sparrow is the 3rd party email client that has proved to be a popular alternative to the stock iOS Mail app, despite some glaring shortcomings.
* You can download Sparrow+ for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repo starting today. You can also download the Sparrow iOS app for $2.99.
* Once you give it a try, be sure to share your thoughts on the combo in the comments section.
