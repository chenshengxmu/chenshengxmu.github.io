* Foursquare’s main iOS app was refreshed earlier today with some new 3D Touch goodies and a redesigned interface on the iPad. Foursquare for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad was part of the initial wave of third-party applications that enabled support for handy Home screen shortcuts via 3D Touch on the new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
* Today’s update added 3D Touch-based Peek and Pop gestures, meaning you can now preview content within the app and pop right into it, without lifting a finger off the screen.
* As shown on the screenshots top of post and below, you can apply pressure to various pieces of content within the Foursquare app. For instance, you can preview a place surfaced through search or in your feed by pressing it firmly.
* Keep holding while peeking and move your finger upward to bring up a sheet with three options: Add to List, Share and Stop Recommending This Place. Press deeper to go full screen.
* 3D Touch works in a couple other places in the app, too. For instance, you can press a map firmly to preview it. Again, moving your finger upward whilst peeking lets you open the full map view in Apple Maps or Google Maps.

* As mentioned, the team’s updated the Foursquare experience on the iPad app with new designs and full support for Split View and Slide Over multitasking modes in iOS 9.
* “And, in a bunch of cities, Foursquare now shows the top list of trending places each week,” according to release notes accompanying the 23.8-megabyte download.
* Foursquare requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later.
* The app is localized in English, Catalan, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Russian.
* Grab Foursquare for iOS at no charge in the App Store.
