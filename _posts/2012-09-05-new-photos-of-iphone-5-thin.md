* With just a week left to go until Apple unveils its new smartphone, the next-gen iPhone leaks are in full swing. Yesterday, we saw pictures of the handset’s battery. And today, this.
* A repair firm has just uploaded photos of a nearly fully assembled iPhone 5 laying next to an iPhone 4. And the shots give us a good idea of just how thin the device is going to be…

* The snapshots were uploaded by iResQ, a Kansas-based iDevice repair shop.
* “We just received the iPhone 5 screen assembly and installed it on our iPhone 5 back casing. What you see is a culmination of all of the parts we have put together on the iPhone 5 so far. From the outside, the iPhone looks pretty much fully assembled aside from the two glass/plastic covers that belong on the top and bottom of back casing.”
* This isn’t the first time we’ve heard that this year’s iPhone is going to be noticeably thinner than its predecessors. Rumors that Apple is using in-cell display tech in its next smartphone and shrinking its charging port to make the device thinner have been swirling around for months.
* How much thinner are we talking? Well the iPhone 4/4S measures in at about 9.3mm deep, and the new iPhone is said to be just 7.6mm deep. So we’re talking about a difference of almost 2mm. For reference, Samsung’s Galaxy S III is 8.6mm thick, and HTC’s One X handset is 8.9mm.
* But despite its thinness, the guys at iResQ say the phone feels “nice” in their hands.
* “So here is an easy way to imagine the thickness of the iPhone 5: remove the glass backplate from your iPhone 4/4S and there you go! That’s the approximate thickness of the iPhone 5. Having the mostly assembled unit in our hands feels nice. It fits in the pocket just fine and I can see myself getting used to the longer screen rather quickly.”
* Outside of its appearance, not much else is known in regards to the next-gen iPhone’s features. Its processor, RAM and front and back camera sensors are still pretty much a mystery at this point. Oh well, at least there will be some surprises at Apple’s iPhone event next week.
