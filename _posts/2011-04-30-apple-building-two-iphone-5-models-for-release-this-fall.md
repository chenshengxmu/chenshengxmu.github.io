* Apple is reportedly building two iPhone 5 models for a scheduled fall release.
* According to an employee of an Apple parts supplier, there is reason to believe that the iPhone 5 will actually be two devices: a ‘standard’ and ‘pro’ model.
* Previous rumors have said that the iPhone 5 would be a significant redesign of its predecessor, and we’ve also heard rumors that the iPhone 5 will end up being only a slight evolution of the iPhone 4.
* Due to the extensive amount of NDAs our source had to sign to work with Apple, he could not give us very many details. He does believe that Apple is going to build two iPhone models, which he referred to as a ‘normal’ and a ‘pro’ version.
* Our source says that Apple is ordering components of similar function, but some of them are the very best of what you can get right now.
* While the rest of the ordered components are just the standard versions, Apple is also ordering better quality components of the same function. Our source says that both types of components wouldn’t go in one device together, which makes him believe Apple is up to something with a ‘pro’ version.
* We believe our source is reliable regarding this information. On top of that, we have also heard from an inside source at Apple that the iPhone 5(s) will definitely not be released until Q2 of this year. Apple’s internal revenue forecast for the next business quarter is the lowest it’s ever been, which means no new iPhone(s) until at least August or September.
* According to our inside source at Apple, the company is making plans for the next iPhone announcement in the fall after the “Back to School” season. The next iPhone announcement will take place in the exact same time frame as Apple’s music and iPod event has in the past.
* This isn’t the first time that we’ve heard about a fall iPhone announcement, and we believe our source has only helped confirm that news.
* Recent rumors of an iPhone 4S have suggested that the next generation iPhone will only be a slight redesign and focus more on internal hardware. We’ve heard that the next iPhone (whether it be two devices or one) will be a global device capable of running on all carriers.
* Perhaps Apple will keep the ‘normal’ version of the iPhone 5 as a carrier-specific device, and introduce a global phone with upgraded specs as the ‘pro’ version.
