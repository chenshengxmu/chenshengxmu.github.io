* If you’re serious about customizing your iPhone’s sound, there’s likely no better candidate to meet your needs than MyVolume.
* This is a jailbreak tweak for serious customizers only; casuals need not apply.
* That’s because MyVolume allows you to modify nearly every function of your iPhone’s volume controls, almost to a fanatic level…

* It’s funny because you don’t really realize how tight Apple’s controls are, until a tweak like this comes around and opens a whole new realm of possibilities.
* MyVolume allows you to add haptic feedback to your volume adjustments, toggle the heads up display on and off, and silent annoying apps altogether, regardless of your volume settings.
* The developer has even ventured as far as to allow you to make incremental adjustments on the amount of volume applied when depressing the + or – volume keys.

* Even with all of that, I think I’ve touched on about fifty percent of the tweak’s capabilities.
* If you’re looking for something that’s going to bring a lot of varied functions to the table, MyVolume isn’t going to be your cup of tea.
* On the other hand, if you’re looking for a tweak that sticks to one thing, and does an incredibly good job of doing said thing, you’d be hard pressed to find another that compares.
* MyVolume is available for jailbroken iPhones, and can be purchased on Cydia for $1.99.
* What are your thoughts?
