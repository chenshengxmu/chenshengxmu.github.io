* Some very good news was made known today by one of the members of the evad3rs — the team responsible for the upcoming evasi0n jailbreak. MuscleNerd, who is a well respected part of this team, has made it known that nearly all iOS 6.1 compatible devices will reap the benefits of the upcoming jailbreak.
* This means that only the Apple TV 3, and possibly the Apple TV 2 will lack support. As far as every other device goes, they’re fair game. Take a look at our full list of iOS  devices that will be jailbreakable on iOS 6.1 after the break…
* Obviously, there are different configurations for many of the devices listed above. For instance, there are cellular, and Wifi only models of the various iPads mentioned. The good news is this: regardless of the configuration, every device posted above will be supported. In total, there are an impressive 22 different configurations that will be jailbreakable on launch day.
* As of now, the only unsupported devices that will be capable of running iOS 6.1 are the Apple TV’s, both 2, and 3. The Apple TV 2 will definitely gain support, but Apple has been slow to release updates for the second generation set top box in order for the team to work on its jailbreak. It will eventually come, though, and perhaps may be supported on jailbreak launch day.
* The Apple TV 3, on the other hand, is a whole new beast. Due to the fact that it uses far less services that can potentially be compromised, it’s a more difficult to corner. It’s certainly possible that we will see an eventual Apple TV 3 jailbreak in the future, but you won’t find support for it in the initial release from team evad3rs.
* Hopefully that clarifies things a little bit for you. So pull out that dusty iPhone 4S, brush off that idle iPad 3, and get ready for some jailbreak goodness coming your way very soon.
* Update:
* The Apple TV 2 will be supported, as Apple has just released updated firmware for it as well. Rejoice, faithful Apple TV owners!
