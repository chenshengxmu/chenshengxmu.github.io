* Microsoft Outlook is one of the finest email clients available for iOS, and this evening, it received an update for iOS 9 that brings 3D Touch support to the iPhone 6s. By using 3D Touch on the Outlook app icon, you can quickly view your calendar, or compose a new event or email directly.
* With the demise of Mailbox, I’m aware that a lot of you will be looking for a new email client to call home. I know that lots of people have been raving about Spark, and rightfully so. But I think you should give Outlook a chance as well.
* Microsoft has done a good job with implementing the basics, so features like push notifications, tightly integrated access to cloud storage providers, and support for multiple email providers, including iCloud email, make the cut.
* What really makes Outlook good is that it’s a universal app that works with both the iPhone and the iPad. The app has even been optimized to work great on the iPad Pro, which is something most email clients can’t claim. It’s one of my must-try iPad Pro apps in this early stage of the super-sized tablet’s life.
* Also, the whole issue with printing directly from an email thread has been resolved in this latest update. As of version 2.0.8, which comes in as a 48.8 MB download, you can now print any message or conversation from the email view.

* Lastly, Outlook features solid support for the Apple Watch, so that you can read full emails, reply, archive, and perform more email management duties right from your wrist.
* Outlook for iOS is a free app, and since Microsoft is backing it, you know there’s no chance that it’s going away like Mailbox or Sparrow before it. Outlook is here to stay, and that’s one reason why I’ve seriously considered making it the permanent home of all of my email.
