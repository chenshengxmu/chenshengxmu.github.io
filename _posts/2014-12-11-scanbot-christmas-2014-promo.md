* Scanbot, a comprehensive, well-designed document scanner and QR reader for the iPhone and iPad, has gone free in a time-limited holiday promotion. You can now grab the $1.99 universal application free in the App Store.
* Those who’ve upgraded to Scanbot Pro via a $4.99 In-App Purchase can send Scanbot Pro as a holiday gift to a friend during the duration of this promotion.
* Just tap the Gift button at the top right corner and share the Christmas coupon with that special someone. Haven’t upgraded yet? Not to worry, you can gift Scanbot Pro at a discount of up to 60 percent. Last but not least, both editions of Scanbot have received several new features listed below the fold.
* Everyone can now enjoy a brand new 3D winter theme with snow, presents and a nice Christmas song. Other goodies: a new waiting interface when reviewing a scan, an optimized B&W filter and more natural drawing signatures.

* This is what’s new in Scanbot 3.2:
* In addition to the goodies mentioned above that are available to all Scanbot users, Scanbot Pro folks have been treated to full-text search support: you can now find any scan in Scanbot within seconds. Full-text search supports file names and even the contents of your OCRed scans.
* Next, Pro users can password-protect their PDFs. It’s quite comprehensive: not only is the password required each time a protected PDF is accessed on one device, but on all your others as well.
* Finally, additional pages can be added to existing scans, which comes in handy when you need to create one PDF with all your receipts from one month, say.
* Here’s what Scanbot Pro users are getting in 3.2 update:
* Scanbot Pro previously gained Touch ID and passcode protection, optical character recognition to turn your scans into text, smart file naming, support for themes and more.
* Apple named Scanbot as one of the Best Apps in 2014 in its annual iTunes Best Of charts.
* Scanbot is available free for a limited time.
* The universal 47.2-megabyte app requires iOS 7.0 or later.
