* Depending on how you use Siri throughout your workflow, you might find a new free jailbreak tweak called AutoDismissSiri by iOS developer Andreas Henriksson to be an advantageous supplement to your jailbroken handset.
* Just as the tweak’s name implies, AutoDismissSiri adds a timeout period to the Siri interface. That said, if Siri would idle on your device for a specific amount of time, then the interface closes automatically.
* After installing AutoDismissSiri, you’ll find a preference pane in the Settings app where you can configure its parameters:

* Here, you can:
* In most cases, you’d close Siri yourself with a press of the Home button or a tap on the screen; but AutoDismissSiri comes in handy when you’re yelling “Hey Siri!” from across the room and don’t have physical access to your handset after your inquiry.
* That said, the tweak should be useful for those who use the hands-free Hey Siri functionality, and having been in these shoes before, we appreciate the attention to detail provided by jailbreak tweaks like AutoDismissSiri when they launch in the Cydia Store.
* If you’re interested in trying AutoDismissSiri, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s Packix repository. The tweak is advertised to work on all jailbroken handsets running iOS 7-11, and the developer has open-sourced the tweak on GitHub for those interested in learning about how the tweak works.
