* The Pangu team has released an update to their jailbreak tool today. Pangu 1.2 is out now for both Windows and Mac, and it includes a handful of bug fixes and improvements that make the jailbreaking process a little easier.
* Among the fixes are a resolution for an ongoing boot loop bug that some iPhone 4/4s users are experiencing, and patches for sandbox log and task_for_pid issues. The new Pangu also brings support for afc2…
* Here is the 1.2 change log:
* – Fix boot loop bug for some iPhone4/4s.
* – Fix sandbox log issue.
* – afc2 is included now.
* – Add patch for task_for_pid.
* – Add notification if jailbreak fail.
* If you have already successfully jailbroken your device using Pangu, then there is no reason for you to do anything at this time. If you’ve been having issues, though, you might want to try restoring and jailbreaking again with Pangu 1.2.
* Pangu 1.2 is compatible with any device running iOS 7.1.x, and you can grab it from our Downloads page. For those of you who aren’t sure how to use the tool, we have tutorials for both Mac and Windows available to walk you through it.
* If you decide to use Pangu 1.2, let us know how it goes below!
