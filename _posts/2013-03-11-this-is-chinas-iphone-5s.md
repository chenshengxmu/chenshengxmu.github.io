title: This is Chinas iPhone 5S
---
* With the iPhone 5S reportedly a few months away, ardent copycat vendors in Shenzen, China took it upon themselves to come up with an iPhone 5S of their own. Meet the GooPhone i5S, a total rip-off based on Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2 which sells for just $149 contract-free.
* Now, imagine if Apple actually made a sub-$200 budget iPhone – or offered a $149 off-contract iPhone 5 for that matter (its cheapest contract-free handset is the $450 iPhone 4). GooPhone’s cheap iPhone lookalike – and I’m using the term loosely here – goes on sale tomorrow and the first 1,000 buyers will pay only $99 for it…
* In case you’re interested, the GooPhone i5S has a four-inch 854-by-480 pixel display, 3G cellular networking, a five-megapixel camera on the back, a 1.3-megapixel forward-facing camera and runs a 1GHz MediaTek MT6577 dual-core processor with 512MB of RAM.
* Granted, these are hardly earth-shattering specs, especially compared to the speedy iPhone 5 with its Retina display and the excellent eight-megapixel camera module, but you get what you pay for.
* Speaking of cheap, perhaps all this talk of an inexpensive iPhone is baseless, maybe Apple really doesn’t know how to make a cheap iPhone that doesn’t suck?
* By the way, you gotta give it to them for modifying Android heavily in order to make the interface resemble iOS as closely as possible. I was also surprised UI wasn’t as much laggy as one would expect Android to be on low-cost hardware.
* If you decide to take the plunge, you can pick up the i5S up over at Android-sale.
