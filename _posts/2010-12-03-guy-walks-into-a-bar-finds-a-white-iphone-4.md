* I’m so sick of white iPhone 4 rumors, yet here I am writing about one. Apparently, another white iPhone 4 has been spotted in public. This time, the mythical device was allegedly spotted at bar (how ironic).
* There have been dozens of proposed reasons for the infamous white iPhone 4 delay. The most popular rumor has been that there is an issue with the white paint coating from the production line.
* Whatever the reason, the official release has been delayed several times. It was “available” for a short time on the Apple Store before it was pulled. The device has been allegedly caught on tape, and legitimately spotted in public…
* MacStories now as their own Gizmodo bar story to share with the world. They have some alleged, close-up spy shots of the mythical white unicorn.

* Cody Fink, from MacStories, talks about this scoop,
* “Spotting a white iPhone 4 is like trying to find Big Foot, and ironically we happened to come across this one at a bar. While my source and I are in cahoots in publicly finding these mythical devices, we are in disagreement about one thing: whether or not the iPhone we saw was produced by Apple or was built as kit.
* There are some discrepancies over the proximity sensor, and we do note that taking flash pictures produced some odd washed-out results compared to its black brethren (which unfortunately, we couldn’t grab off the device).”
* Hopefully, this white iPhone is legitimate. MacStories was a little vague with the details about how they got these photos.
* And maybe this means that Apple is closer to finally releasing the iPhone 4’s white counterpart. I sure hope so, cause I’m sick of talking about it.
* What do you think? Does this story sound legitimate?
