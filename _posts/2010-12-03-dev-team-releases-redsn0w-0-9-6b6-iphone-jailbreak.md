* The Dev Team has just released an update to their RedSn0w jailbreak, which is now at its version 0.9.6b6. This update was released following the battery drain issue experienced by some iPhone users who had unlocked using UltraSn0w.
* This battery drain problem was encountered by those of you who updated the iPhone baseband to 06.15.00 in order to unlock. A fix has now been worked out. You can find this fix hereâ€¦
* In the meanwhile, you may download RedSn0w 0.9.6b6 from our iPhone downloads section.
