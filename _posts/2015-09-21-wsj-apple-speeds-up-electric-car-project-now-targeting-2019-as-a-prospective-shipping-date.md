* Apple’s rumored electric project, code-named Project Titan, has sped up development as the Cupertino company now targets 2019 as a prospective shipping date, The Wall Street Journal said Monday.
* In fact, Apple has internally designating the rumored electric vehicle as a “committed project” after it spent more than a year investigating the feasibility of an Apple-branded car, including meetings with two groups of government officials in California.
* “Leaders of the project have been given permission to triple the 600-person team,” the people familiar with the matter told the paper.
* Interestingly enough, the story claims that Apple is not currently planning on making its first electric vehicle fully autonomous though that capability is purportedly “part of the product’s long-term plans.”
* The report follows The Guardian’s story three days ago claiming that the secret electric car is “ready to leave the lab.”
* As the project now has an official Engineering Program Manager, Apple is reportedly moving to “coordinate the work of teams of hardware and software engineers,” reported the British newspaper last week.
* Apple executive had a meeting last month with officials at California’s department of motor vehicles (DMV) to “review DMV’s autonomous vehicle regulations.”
* The Guardian said in another report that Apple leased in secrecy a private facility testing site at GoMentum Station in California to road-test its vehicle.
* The iPhone maker has hired several high-profile executives from the auto industry and has apparently met with BMW executives to discuss possible technology and manufacturing cooperation.
