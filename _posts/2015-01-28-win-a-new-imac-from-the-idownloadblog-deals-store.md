* Yesterday we announced the launch of our new iDownloadBlog Deals store, and we promised some epic giveaways. Today we’re kicking it off with a bang: we’re giving away a new iMac!
* When the new iMac was released at the end of last year, we were all drooling over this beautiful piece of tech and well… most of us still are.  Probably the sleekest desktop computer ever made, the iMac is only a few inches thick at fattest, and slims down to razor-thin edges. We’re giving away a 21.5-inch model, boasting a 1.4 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 Processor, as well as a 500GB hard drive and 8GB of memory.
* Valued at $1,099, we’re guessing you want to win this beautiful, beautiful computer. So how do you enter? Go the giveaway page on the iDownloadBlog Deals store, and create an account! You’ll get extra entries for following iDB on Twitter and Google+, and get five extra entries for each friend you refer, so don’t forget to share your custom share link on Facebook and Twitter.
* Stay tuned for more awesome giveaways from the iDB Deals store.
