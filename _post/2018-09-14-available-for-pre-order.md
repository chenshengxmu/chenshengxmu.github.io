* The iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and the Apple Watch Series 4 are now available for pre-order. This means that folks in participating launch countries can place orders for the new devices on Apple’s website, the mobile Apple Store app, or via one of Apple’s third-party retail partners.
* As usual we recommend using the Apple Store app, as it offers a more-streamlined shopping experience and is typically more reliable than Apple’s website during periods of heavy traffic. And for those still deciding what to purchase, we’ve put together a list of helpful posts and videos.
* Which one are you getting today?
