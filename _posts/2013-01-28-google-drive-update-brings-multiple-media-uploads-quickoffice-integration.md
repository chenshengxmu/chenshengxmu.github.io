* Five days ago, Google updated Drive for Android with the ability to create, edit, comment and present Google slides in offline mode. Today, the search firm has given some love to its iOS counterpart by adding a few new features you should know about. These include pinch-to-zoom on slides, multiple media uploads, QuickOffice integration and more. Additional information after the break…
* Unlike before, you can now upload multiple photos and video clips to your Drive at once, a handy time-saver for those who happen to upload lots of photos, for example.
* Google in June 2012 snapped up the maker of the popular QuickOffice mobile productivity suit, so no wonder that Drive users can now open and save their QuickOffice documents back to Drive.
* As for spreadsheets, diagonal scrolling means you can freely move around your document with ease. More importantly, users can now format cells (hooray!) with decimals, currencies, date and time and more.
* Google Drive 1.2.2, the new version, is still free. It supports both the iPhone and iPad natively.
* Release notes:
* Drive • multiple photo/video upload • QuickOffice users can open and save back to Drive
* Docs • added Helvetica Neue to supported fonts
* Sheets • diagonal scrolling • cell formatting (Decimals, currency, date and more)
* Slides • improvements to slideshow and animations • pinch to zoom on slides
* Google Drive is a free download for iOS and Android.
