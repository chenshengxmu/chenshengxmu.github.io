* Apple announced a month ago that its futuristic new $5 billion headquarters in Cupertino, California would be named Apple Park. New drone footage from videographer Matthew Roberts now shows that Apple Park is finally starting to come together although some sections are still under construction.
* Although first employees began moving in last month, construction workers will be finalizing landscaping and putting additional finishing touches around the new campus until year-end.

* Clockwise: huge tunnels leading underneath the main building, the visitor kiosk, a fitness center for employees and the main entrance to the underground 1,000-seat theater for press events.
* Apple has been able to plant a lot of mature trees around the campus over the past few weeks and has reused most of the massive pile of the earth it dug up for landscaping work .

* The main ring-shaped building, large enough to house 13,000 employees, is being finalized as we speak. And now, watch the latest birds-eye video of Apple Park from Matthews.
* Other facilities are nearing completion as well.
* Aside from the main ring-shaped building, other nearly-finished facilities include the Tantau Avenue parking garage above ground plus the massive parking garages below ground, the secure research and development centers found on the outskirts of the campus, the kiosk for visitors and tourists and the giant tunnels running underneath the main building.

* Solar panel installations on the roof appear mostly complete.
* On the other hand, there are some unfinished structures on the site but they’re expected to be completed in a matter of weeks. As mentioned, some sections of the main building have been open to employees since the beginning of April.
* How do you like Apple’s new headquarters?
