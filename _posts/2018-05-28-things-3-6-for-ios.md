* German developer Cultured Code today updated its Things task and to-do manager for iPhone, iPad, and Mac with a few improvements, including support for system-wide undo/redo on iOS, wireless keyboard navigation on iPad with a new Type Travel feature and more.
* The iPhone app picked up some useful enhancements, too, including:
* With full support for rich keyboard productivity shortcuts, everything you can do in Things for Mac you can now do on your iPad, including dragging and dropping to-dos in the sidebar and navigating the app with a new Type Travel feature.
* Type Travel has made a leap from Things for iPhone to iPad.
* There’s a really cool feature we built for Mac, called Type Travel. It allows you to navigate Things with your keyboard. You don’t need a shortcut to use it—just start typing where in the app you want to go and instantly you’re transported there.
* It’s magic. We’ve now brought this feature to iPad and it really shines here. It’s amazing how quickly you can get around without even lifting a hand.
* Before you can use a shortcut, you need a persistent selection in the list that you can target. To try this out, open Things 3.6 and tap the down arrow key. This will select your first to-do. Now you can move the selection around with the arrow keys or hold down the Shift key and use the arrows to select more to-dos, just like in Things for Mac.

* In fact, you can now fully control the app with just your keyboard.
* MacStories editor-in-chief Federico Viticci noted in his review of Things 3.6 that the update marks the best implementation of external keyboard control he’s ever seen in any iPad app.
* “This goes much deeper than a handful of shortcuts—you can interact, navigate and edit tasks in the app without ever leaving the keyboard,” he wrote.
* Here are a few examples of the iPad keyboard shortcuts in Thing 3.6:
* The Mac also received a refresh to ensure consistency with the new iPad keyboard shortcuts:
* All told, they’ve implemented 70+ productivity shortcuts across the app.
* Press and hold the Command (⌘) key on your wireless keyboard in any section of the app to see the list of available shortcuts or check out the full list on the Cultured Code website.
* To illustrate true power of these keyboard shortcuts, developers have put together a little promotional video which you can see embedded right below.
* Music: Peter Thomas Gromer
* It’s interesting that the iPad screen wasn’t touched once in the recording of the video.
* The Things apps apps are available on Mac, iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.
* Things 3.6 is a free update for existing customers.
* An Apple Design Award Winner 2017, Things for iOS is $9.99 on App Store.
* Things for macOS is in Mac App Store.
