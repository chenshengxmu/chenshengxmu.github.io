* Google today updated its official YouTube TV app with support for AirPlay, an Apple technology that lets you play video streamed from your iPhone or iPad on a TV set through your Apple TV.
* “Announcing AirPlay! There are a few bug fixes and minor improvements in this thing, too. But mostly AirPlay,” reads the changelog for YouTube TV on App Store.
* Prior to today’s update, YouTube TV only supported broadcasting content from the app to a television set via Google’s Chromecast HDMI dongle.
* Google launched its new streaming television service back in April 2017.
* In exchange for $35 per month, cord-cutters can enjoy live TV streaming from Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC and other popular cable networks along with content from an additional 39 local broadcast networks and channels, like ESPN.
* Some sports channels like Fox Soccer Plus, as well as premium networks such as Showtime, are available for an additional monthly charge. DVR with unlimited storage is included in the subscription at no additional charge.
* YouTube TV can be used with up to six accounts in a single household without needing to share passwords between family members.
* YouTube TV is separate from the YouTube Red service, which costs ten bucks per month.
* YouTube TV is currently limited to select cities, like Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area.

* You can try YouTube TV free for 30 days by signing up at tv.youtube.com.
