* Apple today refreshed its MacBook Pro notebook lineup with the latest Intel chips, twice the RAM and other goodies, including an enhanced version of the company’s second-generation T2 coprocessor that now brings “Hey Siri” to the Mac platform for the first time.
* Tucked away as a side-note in the press release announcing the upgraded MacBook Pros is a mention of the enhanced Apple T2 chip that the company says delivers improved system security and the “Hey Siri” feature to the upgraded machines.
* An in-house designed cryptographic coprocessor based on ARM technology and featuring a dedicated Secure Enclave, T2 offloads background listening of the “Hey Siri” phrase from the power-hungry Intel chip to the power-sipping T2 silicon.
* Apple describes it as follows:
* Introducing the Apple T2 chip — second‑generation custom Mac silicon designed by Apple to make MacBook Pro even more secure. Featured on the 13- and 15‑inch models with Touch Bar, the Apple T2 chip includes a Secure Enclave coprocessor that provides the foundation for secure boot and encrypted storage capabilities.
* It also consolidates many discrete controllers, including the system management controller, audio controller and SSD controller, into one. And the Apple T2 chip brings a familiar voice to MacBook Pro — Hey Siri is always ready to open apps, find documents, play music or answer your questions.
* Like its predecessor, the T2 chip also serves as a secure enclave for encrypted keys and handles system functions such as secure system boot, audio control, solid state storage and enhanced imaging processing for the built-in camera.
* The T2 chip was first introduced in the 2017 iMac Pro.
