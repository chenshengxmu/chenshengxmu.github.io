* As promised by Tim Cook, Apple new 4th generation Apple TV just went on sale on Apple’s online store. Coming in both 32 and 64 GB flavors, the new Apple TV starts at $149 for the lower storage tier, and caps off at $199 for the higher storage tier.
* The new Apple TV 4, which comes bundled with Apple’s new Siri Remote, is the first Apple TV to be able to run full-fledged apps from the App Store thanks to its new operating system, tvOS. The ability to run apps and search with Siri are two of the big headlining features for the refresh. Users can also expect a modern looking UI with a familiar, yet refreshed, interface.

* The set top box itself, sports a very similar design to the 2nd and 3rd generation units, except this version is taller to accommodate the extra components and extra heat generated by the powerful A8 chip and 2GB of RAM stuffed inside.

* While the Apple TV has always been seen as a “hobby” device by the executive brass at Apple, this launch signifies the first major push that Apple is making to capture the living room. Not only has Apple opened up the device to developers, but it’s also been long-rumored to be courting TV networks to eventually add a true live streaming service to the table.
* If you order your Apple TV 4 now, you can expect the unit to ship by the end of this week. We’ve already ordered ours, and you can expect a full unboxing, impressions, and a review in the coming days and weeks.
* Are you ordering a new Apple TV 4? If so, which storage level did you decide to go for? I went for the 64GB version, just because I plan on installing lots of games, and emulators, too.
