* SwitcherMod is a new jailbreak application available in Cydia that supposedly improves the iPhone app switcher. I say “supposedly” because I fail to see the usefulness of this applications.
* Developed my Ryan Petrich, one of my favorite jailbreak developers, SwitcherMod allows you to drag icons to reorder them. It also allows you to make exited apps transparent and show the “close” button by default…
* SwitcherMod is free in Cydia via the http://rpetri.ch/repo repo.
* Give it a try and let me know how useful you think it is.
