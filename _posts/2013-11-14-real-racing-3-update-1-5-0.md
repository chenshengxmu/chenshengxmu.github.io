* Hot on the heels of the major Ferrari update last month, the folks at EA have posted another new version of its popular Real Racing 3 game this week that brings about more new cars, new events and new features.
* As for the cars, some new Ferraris have joined the family including the 458 Spider, the 599 GTO, and the prestigious Enzo. And as for the new events and features, there’s now weekly time trials and race replays…
* Here is the full 1.5 change log:
* – New Cars – the Enzo Ferrari joins the family of extreme performance cars, along with the 458 Spider and 599 GTO  – Weekly Time Trial Tournaments – climb to the top of global leaderboards and win huge R$ and Gold prizes! – Race Replays – relive your victory with full cinematic cameras and playback controls – 4 New Event Series – dominate the competition in over 100 new events
* And for those that missed it, the Ferrari trailer:
* EA seems to have Real Racing 3 on a monthly update schedule lately. Last month’s aforementioned Ferrari update came just a little more than a month after the Porsche release, which also added new vehicles and features.
* Again, Real Racing 3 is a ‘freemium title,’ meaning it’s free to play but you’ll be encouraged to snag some in-app purchases. Regardless, the game is well-reviewed, and can be found in the App Store for free if you’re interested.
