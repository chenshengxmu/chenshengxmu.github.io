* Unless you live under a rock, you probably know by now that AT&T is in the process of buying out T-Mobile for $39 billion. According to T-Mobile execs themselves, the US branch of Deutsche Telekom was not doing very well financially speaking, and this is all the iPhone’s fault.
* According to the NY Times, things started going downhill for T-Mobile US in 2007, when customers would leave T-Mobile by the boatload to get on AT&T who was the only one selling the iPhone at the time. I was actually one of those people who left T-Mobile for the iPhone…
* During 2010 alone, T-Mobile USA said it lost 390,000 contract customers to rivals.
* “The iPhone effect cannot be underestimated in this decision,” said Theo Kitz, an analyst at Merck Finck, a private bank in Munich. “Without being able to sell the iPhone, T-Mobile was in an unsustainable position and T-Mobile USA became a problem child.”
* Obviously the iPhone is not the only cause behind the sale of T-Mobile to AT&T but it undoubtedly played an important role.
