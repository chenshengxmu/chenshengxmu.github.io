* For folks who like to listen to podcasts on the go, there are a number of app choices out there. We’ve covered several of them over the years, including Apple’s native Podcast app, Instacast and Castro, and today we’re adding another one to the list: Stitcher Radio for Podcasts.
* Now, the Stitcher Radio app obviously isn’t new, but it might as well be after this weekend’s 6.0 update. The client has been virtually rebuilt from the ground up with a new front page, simplified navigation and redesigned player controls. Keep reading for the full change log…
* What’s New in Version 6.0.0
* For a long time I’ve been using Apple’s native Podcast app. It may not have all of the features that others have, or as sharp of design, but it syncs with iTunes and gets the job done. I did, however grab the new Stitcher Radio app this weekend, and I must say I’m impressed.

* The app has all of the standard podcast options, but my favorite might be ‘My Front Page.’ It’s the first thing you see when you open Stitcher, and it offers up podcast suggestions based on news headlines. It seems like this would be a great way to keep up with current events.
* If you’re interested, I recommend checking it out for yourself. You can grab the new Stitcher Radio for Podcasts from the App Store for free. And if you do, be sure to add iDB’s two podcasts: Let’s Talk iOS and Let’s Talk Jailbreak. You can find them via search, or here.
