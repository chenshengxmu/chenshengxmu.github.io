* iOttie seems to have done what pretty much no other manufacturer has done so far, and created a wireless charger that doesn’t look like a boring round puck. They’ve stepped outside the box to create a more modern looking Qi wireless charger with up to 10W of power.
* At CES 2018, iOttie has released several new wireless charging products, though my favorite is their well-designed iON Wireless Fast Charging Pad.

* It has a soft canvas-like finish, that is available in 5 different colors, all of which look pretty great. To keep your phone from sliding off that fabric, there is a subtle silicone ring.

* It utilizes USB-C for power (over the antiquated Micro USB), and has a secondary USB-A port in the back to charge a second device. It supports up to 10W of power and will work with iOS and Android.
* Aside from the full-size charging pad, they’ve also released a mini version, and a stand version.

* I am undoubtedly a fan of these chargers and can’t wait to test them out when they become available.
* The biggest (only?) downside is that they don’t include a power brick in the box, so you will have to provide your own.
* Pricing and availability aren’t currently available, but hopefully we should see them soon.
