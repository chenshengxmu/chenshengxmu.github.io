* Samsung has been using its “Do What You Can’t” tagline in Galaxy advertising since about a year ago and it’s been working out nicely for them. The company wants customers to realize that “Do What You Can’t” is what they do every day, not just a marketing slogan, so they’ve put together an impressive brand philosophy video.
* Published earlier this week on Samsung Mobile’s YouTube channel, the one-and-a-half-minute video clip does a great job highlighting Samsung’s key competitive advantages, such as vertical integration, a deep product portfolio spanning mobile devices, refrigerators, washing machines, smart home products and TVs, the fact that its devices work seamlessly together and more.

* Here’s Samsung message from the video:
* Our mission it to help you do the impossible. We’re engineers. Inventors. Problem solvers. What matters to you, inspires what we do.
* Because you want a bigger screen, not a bigger phone, we took the display right to the edge. Because you forget what’s in your fridge, we let you look inside from anywhere.
* Because your TV isn’t always on, we turned it into art when it’s off. Because you always find one sock, we let you add it while you wash.
* Because you want to be there, when you’re not there, we made it simple to share the moment. Because you want your things to work together, we’re making it seamless to connect them all.
* We make what can’t be made so you can do what can’t be done.
* Give it a quick watch below.
* “’Do What You Can’t’ isn’t just a slogan, it’s what we do every day. Our mission is to help you do what can’t be done. And what inspires you, inspires what we make. Because can’t is only what you can’t do yet,“ reads the video’s description.
* I’m not a huge fan of Samsung’s advertising, but I do think that the South Korean conglomerate’s video does a stellar job communicating its competitive advantages in a pretty uplifting manner.
* How do you like Samsung’s brand philosophy ad?
