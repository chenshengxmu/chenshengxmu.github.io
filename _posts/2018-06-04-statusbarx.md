* Love it or hate it, the iPhone X Status Bar looks different from the one on traditional rectangular-display iPhones. Its unique aesthetic accommodates the ‘notch’ at the top of the handset’s display.
* But if you have an iPhone with a traditional rectangular display and wish your Status Bar looked more like it did on the iPhone X, then you might want to try a new free jailbreak tweak called StatusBarX by iOS developer Adel Hammoud.
* As depicted by the screenshot example above, StatusBarX ports the iPhone X Status Bar experience to other iPhones and iPads by moving the time to the left and information concerning your current wireless connection and battery life to the right.
* Notably, the tweak doesn’t emulate a ‘notch’ at the top of your display. Instead, it leaves an empty space just above your Home Screen icons. Even then, it doesn’t look half bad, at least in my opinion.
* In its current form, StatusBarX is a work in progress. That said, it only works from SpringBoard and not from within apps. In unsupported interfaces, the traditional Status Bar appears. It will remain this way until the developer discovers how to make the tweak work systemwide.
* If you want to give StatusBarX a try for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices and doesn’t come with any options to configure.
* Do you like the iPhone X-style Status Bar or the traditional Status Bar more? Share in the comments section below.
