* Two days following the developer-only release of iOS 10 beta 3, Apple today released iOS 10 Public Beta 2 for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The software is now available to public beta testers who are signed on the Apple Beta Software Program.
* For those wondering, iOS 10 Public Beta 2 and developer beta 3 offer the same features.
* Folks on the first public beta with an appropriate configuration profile installed on their device should see an over-the-air download in Settings → General → Software Update.
* NOTE: the second public beta and the third developer beta offer the same features.
* Here’s our own Andrew O’Hara with a walkthrough video detailing changes in iOS 10 Public Beta 2, which corresponds to developer-only beta 3.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube for more videos from the iDB team.
* iOS 10 Public Beta 2 contains fixes for 3D Touch and replying to texts from the Lock screen, a softer keyboard clicking sound, a new Rest Finger to Open switch in Accessibility settings allowing you to correctly revert the unlock behavior to iOS 9, subtle haptic feedback when locking the device manually, Notification Center and Music app tweaks, App Store for iMessage Apps and other goodies.
