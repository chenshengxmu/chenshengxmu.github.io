title: Apples generous offer to Samsung- half a cent per device

* We told you yesterday that court-mediated talks between Apple CEO Tim Cook and his Samsung counterparts fell apart as the two frenemies are scheduled to duke it out in a high-profile U.S. lawsuit next Monday, July 30 that could easily have serious ramifications for both firms.
* The two sides just couldn’t agree on the value of each other’s patents, it’s been said. Patent expert Florian Müeller did some digging and discovered Apple’s terms, including the money value the company put on Samsung’s patents…
* According to Müeller’s post over at his FOSS Patents blog, Cupertino wants Samsung to pay up for $500 million in lost profits, $25 million in royalty damages and a whopping $2 billion for the profits Samsung “unjustly received” using Apple’s intellectual property.
* Apple is also offering half a cent per standard-essential patent per device, or  $0.0049. Samsung wanted something in the neighborhood of 2.4 percent on Apple’s sales based on its patented wireless and cellular technology Apple’s mobile products utilize.
* And as pointed out by Philip Elmer-DeWitt over at the Fortune blog, Apple is also seeking the following for its patents Samsung allegedly infringed upon.
* $2.02 for the “overscroll bounce” (or “rubber-banding”) ‘318 patent $3.10 for the “scrolling API” ‘915 patent $2.02 for the “tap to zoom and navigate” ‘163 patent $24 for use of any of Apple’s design patents or trade dress rights
* No wonder Cook and Samsung couldn’t agree upon terms of an eventual settlement, the two companies clearly have vastly different expectations as to the value of their respective patents.
* If Apple wins the case, Samsung will be in big trouble as the court will enforce sales ban on its products in the U.S. and elsewhere.
* Should the South Korean conglomerate prevail, however, Apple’s legal position could be weakened as it is using the same patents assert against Samsung in its fight against other Android backers.
* It is generally thought that Samsung has way more patents related to 3G/4G technologies than Apple so Cupertino is conceivably treading on thin ice here.
* Thoughts?
