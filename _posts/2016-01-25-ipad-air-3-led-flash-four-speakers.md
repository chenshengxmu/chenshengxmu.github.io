* A purported drawing published Monday by French blog NowhereElse.fr indicates that Apple’s third-generation iPad Air might borrow the iPad Pro’s four-speaker setup for better audio reproduction.
* In addition, the tablet could sport a LED flash. The site has obtained the design drawing from a fairly reliable source though it couldn’t vouch for the veracity of the leaked image.
* Here’s what it looks like.

* The presence of the four integrated speakers at the top and bottom should resemble the iPad Pro’s four-speaker placement, which has mostly been praised in reviews as enabling a richer audio experience.
* As for the LED flash, it might not be the addition that will excite many customers as most people take pictures with their phones but it’s certainly a reassuring sign that Apple continues to perfect its iPad lineup.
