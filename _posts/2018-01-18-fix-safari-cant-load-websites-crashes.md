* There are a few things you can do to troubleshoot issues with Safari when the browser can’t load a website, displays a blank page, or just unexpectedly crashes on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. We’re going to go over these steps and hopefully fix this problem.
* Make sure the site you are trying to access is up and running: It may sound obvious, but maybe the problem isn’t caused by your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, but rather by the website you are trying to access. When I have issues with my internet connection or browser, the first thing I usually do is try to access google.com. If Google loads fine, then I try a few other websites randomly. If they all work, I go back to the first website I was trying to load and try to confirm whether it is down or if it’s a problem with my browser.
* Check your router: Once I’m able to confirm the problem comes from my own set up and not from the website I’m trying to access, my next check is the router. Is it on? Are my other devices able to connect to the web and load pages fine? If not, I unplug the modem and router for a few seconds and plug them back in.
* Toggle Airplane Mode on and off: If the problem is limited to only one of my devices, say my iPhone, I usually turn Airplane Mode on and off. This temporarily disables all antennas on the device, and quite frankly, it’s often my most successful way of getting back online.
* Reboot: When in doubt, a good old reboot of your device is always a safe bet as it might just iron out any temporary bugs that just needed to be flushed out.
* Clear cache and website data: Caching errors are often to blame for web browsing issues, especially when these issues are specific to one site in particular. To rule out this problem, clear your Safari history and website data. This will remove all cookies, caches, and website data on your device. To do so, go to Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data on your iPhone or iPad. On Mac, go to Safari in the menu bar, then select Clear History…
* Try a different browser: Still can’t seem to load a webpage in Safari? Then try Chrome or another browser to figure out whether the problem is from Safari itself.
* Disable content blockers and extensions: By now, if you’ve identified the problem is from Safari itself, try to narrow it down to extensions or content blockers you might have installed on your device. On your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings > Safari > Content Blockers, and disable all of them, if any. On your Mac, go to Safari > Preferences > Websites > Content Blockers, and disable all of them, if any. Also go to Safari > Preferences > Extensions, and disable all active extensions you may have. Quit Safari, then launch it again.
* Hopefully by then you have narrowed down the problem for Safari not loading websites and found the fix for it.
* When nothing else works, make sure your operating system is up to date. If not, make sure to update to the latest version available, which even though it may seem unrelated, could fix your problem. If nothing else works, get in touch with Apple Support as they will be able to run specific diagnostics on the device to hopefully figure out what the problem is and how to fix it.
