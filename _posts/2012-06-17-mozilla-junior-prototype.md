* Mozilla, a non-profit organization behind the Firefox browser, is prototyping a brand new web browser for Apple’s iPad.
* It’s called Junior and aims to replace a “miserable Safari experience” with “something entirely new”, an app which looks to “reinvent the browser for a new form factor”…
* These bold claims are credited to Mozilla’s Alex Limi who demoed the prototype app during Mozilla’s Product Design Strategy team meeting this past Thursday.
* While Mozilla is unable to bring Firefox’s rendering platform called Gecko to iOS due to Apple-imposed restrictions (all third-party web browsers must use WebKit) and only has a Firefox syncing app available on the App Store, it says Junior’s innovation is its minimalism.
* According to The Verge, and confirmed in a blog post by Mozilla, Junior is “an iPad browser that makes browsing more fun, more ergonomic and re-thinks browser user experience from the ground up”.
* This entails a couple of interesting design trade offs. For example, Junior has no tabs and instead focuses on a full-screen experience.
* Rather than sticking an address bar (and tabs) at the top of the app, Junior’s predominant user interface consists of two buttons placed about a third the way up the iPad’s screen.
* First is a back arrow, and that does exactly what you’ve come to expect. On the right side of the screen is a plus symbol, and that’s how you’ll be interacting with the browser most often.
* Tap the plus symbol and you can do three things: access recent pages at the top, visit your favorites/bookmarks or bring up a unified search/URL bar at the bottom.
* Blurry screenshots? Talk to CNET.

* Another useful feature: swipe to the left to access a password-protected login menu supporting multiple accounts (useful for sharing iPad with family members) and other things like private browsing.
* The browser is still rough around the edges and it wasn’t immediately clear when Mozilla intends on shipping the final version.
* Check out Mozilla’s quick video walkthrough right below.
* Yahoo recently released an iOS browser called Axis and Google is rumored to be at work developing a native Chrome experience on the iPad. A popular Android browser called Dolphin got ported to iOS last August, offering a smooth experience and a host of interesting features.
* Apple of course isn’t standing still either. The company unveiled several Safari enhancements in iOS 6. For example, Safari in iOS 6 feels a lot zippier compared to iOS 5.
* It also supports media uploads and brings a number of little tweaks, like full-screen browsing in landscape, iCloud Tabs that auto-sync open tabs across devices, Offline Reading List and Smart App Banners that act as subtle reminders that a website you’re visiting has a native iOS app available.
