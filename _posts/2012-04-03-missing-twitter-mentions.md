* Twitter integration with iOS has led to huge sign-up numbers for the social network. Add those new users to the throngs of iPhone owners that were already big Twitter users, and it’s safe to say that there are plenty of Twitter accounts plugged into iPhones.
* We’re also willing to bet that a fair chunk of those are using the official Twitter app, and it appears that some of those may be experiencing an odd bug, and one that is rather annoying – users are reporting that they are unable to see their own @replies in the Connect tab of the iOS Twitter app. We’ve seen this first hand, and it is indeed rather odd.
* No amount of refreshing, rebooting or force-closing fixes it. Thankfully though, there is one fix that works, and it’s really rather simple…
* As Mashable reports, and as our own testing concludes, deleting your Twitter account from your iPhone’s Settings app and then re-adding it seems to give the accompanying Twitter app the jolt it needs. We’re not sure why this happens, and it appears that Twitter itself isn’t entirely sure either, but this quick fix does seem to do the trick.
* Interestingly, we haven’t seen this issue crop up with any other Twitter apps, and with Android owners also suffering, it is clear that the issue lies with the app rather than iOS.
* If you’ve experienced this problem, do let us know in the comments. We’d be particularly interested to hear if this fix works for you and whether the issue has returned or not. So far we haven’t had the same problem again on the iPhone 4S that suffered the bug late last week, so here’s to hoping it’s gone for good.
* We’re not going to hold our breath, though.
