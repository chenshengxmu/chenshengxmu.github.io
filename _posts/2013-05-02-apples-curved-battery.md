* The days of boxy computers are history, so why are the batteries which power them still the same shape? That’s the question a pair of new Apple patent applications seek to answer. The patents filed in 2011 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office describe “non-rectangular batteries for portable devices.”
* The iPhone and iPad maker outlines a way to customize the shape of batteries to fit the flexibility of today’s consumer electronics, including the growing array of wearable devices, such as the highly-discussed iWatch or Google’s Glass eyewear…
* A pair of Apple patent filings (here and here), both filed on October 28, 2011, outline enclosing battery components in a flexible pouch that molds to a product. The other filing discusses ways of designing batteries which fit curved products of varying depth.
* Both inventions could shape a mobile battery so it fits better into a housing and reduce wasted internal space.

* In some embodiments, Apple explains that the curve “may be formed at one or more ends of the battery cell to allow the battery cell to occupy a curved and/or rounded space within the enclosure of a laptop computer, tablet computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), digital camera, portable media player and/or other type of battery-powered electronic device.”

* While there is no certainty the new battery designs will appear in any Apple products, the company has proposed a number of devices where such flexibility would be an advantage. Along with the much-ballyhooed iWatch, which appears to combine some iPhone technology with a wristwatch, Apple has proposed handsets with wrap-around displays.

* The wearable-computing sector, after losing mindshare, has enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence. Google has been all over the airwaves promoting its Google Glass eye-wear, which brings a heads-up display to real life.
* However, Apple has not been silent, offering a number of options for wearable computing.
