* Folks who missed the opportunity to grab Bicolor when it was offered for free in the Apple Store app will be happy to hear that it’s gone on sale again. Apple is offering the popular game for free from now through next Thursday as part of its App of the Week promotion.
* For those unfamiliar with the title, Bicolor is a deceptively-complex puzzler that tasks players with solving 240 handmade puzzles. In each level you must figure out how to draw a path with one color, and then cover it up with another using the right amount of moves.
* In its Editors’ Notes section, Apple calls Bicolor a “fascinatingly minimal game, that will keep you captivated with intriguing controls, euphoria-inducing audio design, and deceptively difficult puzzles.” It adds that it’s incredibly easy to learn, but very difficult to master.
* Here’s a video of the game in action:
* Admittedly, the game is a little intimidating and tough to understand before playing it, but once you get into the tutorial it’s easy to catch on. We named Bicolor one of our Apps of the Week in May, and we think it’s definitely worth grabbing from the App Store while it’s free.
