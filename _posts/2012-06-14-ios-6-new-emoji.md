* Those of you that are really into Emoji will be happy to learn that iOS 6 is bringing a multitude of new icons to the mix.
* The ones displayed in the image above are just a few examples of what’s to come in Apple’s latest mobile operating system, which is still in beta, and should be released to the public in the Fall…
* This tip came to us from iDB reader Thiago who seemed particularly excited about the new animal faces.
* If like Thiago you find something new or exciting in iOS 6, please make sure to let us know.
