* Apple is planning updates for its MacBook and MacBook Pro lines later this year, according to a research note from KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo. The noted analyst says the new notebooks will feature Intel’s next-generation Kaby Lake processors and updated RAM options.
* Kuo says the refreshed 12-inch MacBook models will enter mass production as early as March, and may offer a new 16GB RAM option (currently capped off at 8GB). As for the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models, he doesn’t see production starting until early third quarter.
* Interestingly, Kuo’s note also mentions that Apple is planning a “15-inch MacBook” with 32GB of RAM  for later in the year—possibly Q4. He believes the RAM will be “desktop class” to satisfy high-end users, but other than that and faster processors, they’ll be very similar to the 2016 models.
* Apple received quite a bit of backlash for its latest MacBook Pro release. While the laptop features the new Touch Bar/Touch ID support, it also lacks legacy ports, a 32GB RAM option, and has a higher price tag than previous models. It’ll be interesting to see how the company responds in future updates.
