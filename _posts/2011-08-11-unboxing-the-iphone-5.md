* Believe it or not, someone is already unboxing the iPhone 5. Chances of it being fake? I’d say 99.9%. But who knows, there’s always a slim, little chance.
* The video was posted on YouTube by ZAGG, the people that make the InvisibleShield. I highly suspect this video was put up together to get attention. And it worked…
* Yes, this is obviously a marketing stunt by ZAGG, but it will keep us entertained until the real iPhone 5 comes out.
