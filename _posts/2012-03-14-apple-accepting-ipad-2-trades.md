* Looking to sell your old iPad to help pay for a new one? Well, we’ve already shown you a number of places to sell or trade-in your old tablet for cash. But now it looks like you can take your iPad straight back to its manufacturer.
* As noted by TheNextWeb, Apple has updated its Reuse and Recycling program to include trade-in values for iPad 2s. The company is now offering up to $320 for the year-old tablet, depending on its model and condition…
* If in perfect condition, Apple will give you:
* The money comes in the form of an Apple Store gift card, so unless you’re planning on using it there, you may want to reconsider. Otherwise, the trade-in values appear to be on par with other services like Gazelle or ecoNew.
* If you’re looking to get top dollar for your old tablet, Amazon still appears to be the best choice. The online retailer is offering up to $500 for used iPad 2s, but keep in mind that Amazon’s payment also comes in the form of a gift card.
