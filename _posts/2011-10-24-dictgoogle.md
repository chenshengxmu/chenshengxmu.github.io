* The built in dictionary is probably one of my favorite new features in iOS 5. It’s so incredibly handy, and it can be used across any app at any time.
* Wouldn’t it be nice if you could search Google in the same way? Well now you can, thanks to DictGoogle — a new tweak that integrates seamlessly with iOS 5’s built in dictionary…
* DictGoogle places an action button in the upper left-hand corner of the dictionary definition page; pressing the button invokes a quick Google search.
* If the dictionary definition alone isn’t enough for you, then DictGoogle allows you to perform a Google query with just the touch of a button.
* If you want to try DictGoogle, head over to Cydia where it can be download for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* I told you it was useful, don’t you agree?
