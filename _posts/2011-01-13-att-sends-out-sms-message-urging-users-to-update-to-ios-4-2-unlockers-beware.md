* If you’re rocking an unlocked phone, it would behoove you to stick to the tried and true suggestions from the Dev Team to stay away from official updates. AT&T has recently started sending out mass text messages urging customers to update to iOS 4.2.
* Why would they do this? Since AT&T is already on the cusp of losing quite a few users to Verizon’s iPhone once it is released, the company is in a frenzy trying to convince customers to stick with them…
* If you can remember, they even offered early upgrades for iPhone 4’s in order to lock customers into another 2-year deal. This was done because they knew that the Verizon iPhone was only six months away.

* Now, AT&T is spamming customers via SMS urging them to update to iOS 4.2. Well, as we know, there is currently no unlock for this firmware version.
* So, say a customer wanted to dump AT&T for Verizon? Naturally, they’d want to sell their current iPhone in order to recoup the costs of the early termination fee if they were still locked into a deal.
* Having an unlocked phone means that you could sell the iPhone to either an AT&T or T-Mobile customer. If your phone is locked, though, your only choice is AT&T until an unlock is released.
* If the purchaser of the iPhone is thereby locked into AT&T, then AT&T doesn’t really lose a customer; see how that all works out?
* Whether or not an unlock will be released before the iPhone launches on Verizon is anyone’s guess, but for the conspiracy theorist, it sure sounds like a sneaky plan, doesn’t it?
