* MuscleNerd confirmed on Twitter earlier today that the Dev Team has figured out a way to use LimeRa1n, GreenPois0n, and PwnageTool for all future firmwares of devices boasting an A4 chip.
* Even better, all future jailbreaks for iOS devices with an A4 chip will be untethered. That’s a good news for iPhone 4 owners, as well as Apple TV, iPad and iPod Touch 4G users… 
* For those of you who don’t know what a tethered jailbreak is, it basically means you have to plug your iPhone in your computer and run the jailbreak again. That’s a very inconvenient process to say the least.
* Hopefully this means that when iOS 4.2 comes out next month, the Dev Team will be able to release update to their jailbreaks rapidly.
* What’s your take on that?
