* Footwear, apparel and sports accessories giant Nike on Monday announced four new bands for Apple Watch, designed to color-match the company’s new Air VaporMax Flyknit “Day to Night” running shoe collection. The new bands work with any Apple Watch model, not just with the special-edition Apple Watch Nike+ collection, and are made from a flexible fluoroelastomer material that’s lightweight and perforated for ventilation and sweat management, like other Sports bands.
* The new bands are priced at $49 each as with other Sports bands.
* They’ll be available via Nike’s online and retail stores on June 1, and Apple.com, select Apple Authorized Resellers and select specialty and department stores in early June.

* The new Air VaporMax Flyknit “Day to Night” running shoe collection celebrates runners whenever they choose to run: at twilight, sunset and everything in between. Each of the new (previously unavailable) band colors is inspired by a shade of the sky, from dawn to dusk, according to the apparel giant.
* The new band collection was designed to allow runners to “make a statement by matching their Apple Watch Nike+ bands to their footwear,” reads the press release. Nike’s new running shoe collection launches next Thursday, June 1, at 10am, priced at $190.
* In April 2017, Apple and NikeLab launched another limited-edition Apple Watch in the form of Apple Watch NikeLab, which pairs a Space Gray aluminum case with a new Light Bone band in a creamy color combination with black perforations.

* Nike’s new Light Bone/Black band combination for Apple Watch NikeLab coordinates nicely with their similarly neutral-toned “Oreo” and “White/Blue” VaporMax sneakers.
* watchOS 3.2 added some new unique face colors, including the new band-matching Blue Orbit and Violet Dust options for Apple Watch Nike+ wearers and Camellia, Flamingo, Pollen, Mist Blue, Azure and Pebble as the new watch face color options for all Apple Watch models.
* Nike began selling standalone versions of its unique Sports bands for Apple Watch earlier this year. Last but not least, earlier this month the company began selling iPhone 7 cases based on its Rosche and Air Force 1 sneakers, priced at $35 each.
* Apple recently refreshed its own band lineup for Apple Watch with some interesting new Spring-themed straps.
