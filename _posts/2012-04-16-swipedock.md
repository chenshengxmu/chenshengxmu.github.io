* SwipeDock is a new jailbreak tweak available on Cydia’s BigBoss repo that allows you to hide your dock with a swipe.
* The tweak includes nearly a dozen dock hiding animations along with many more options to customize it to your liking.
* If you’re searching for more Home screen real estate, or simple want a cool tweak to show off to your family and friends, be sure to check out our video walkthrough…
* By default, SwipeDock allows you to hide the dock with a single finger swipe, but there are options to enable 2 fingers or even 3 fingers. If multitouch gestures aren’t really your thing, there’s even an option to use Activator instead.
* SwipeDock also lends an option to allow an additional row of icons on your Home screen. Normally this would be a tight squeeze, but because of the tweak’s dock hiding capabilities, it allows for one to adequately navigate between his or her favorite apps with ease.
* For $0.99 on Cydia, you can give SwipeDock a try for yourself. If you decide to do so, you know the drill by now; let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
