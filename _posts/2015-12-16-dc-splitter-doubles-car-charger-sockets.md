* Some cars have just one power outlet (aka cigarette lighter) to be shared amongst all gadget-using travelers. There are multi-USB adapters that help spread the wealth, but it would be even better if there were two power outlets.
* Bestek makes an adapter that splits into two DC power outlets and provides two USB ports for all your charging needs. If you add something like the EleckeyTM or the reVOLT, then youâ€™re talking six charges at a time.
* The splitter has 150 watts of power with an input and output of 12/24 volts. The USB ports provide 2.1 amps per port. The company notes that you should only use one USB port at a time if you are juicing up an iPad.
* The ports glow from the blue internal lighting system whenever the splitter is plugged in, which makes it easier for you to find the outlets in the dark.
* It also has a two-foot cable, so you can drag it into the back seat to let the kids charge up their video game systems.
* This dual socket, two USB port splitter is highly rated on Amazon with 4.5 stars across more than 1,500 reviews. You can pick one up today for $15. If two DC sockets and two USB ports are not enough for your growing family, there is also a three DC socket and four USB port splitter from the same company for $20.
