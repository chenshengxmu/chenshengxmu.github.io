* As noted on Apple’s System Status webpage for consumers and the corresponding dashboard for developers, many iCloud services are currently displaying “intermittent issues”.
* These ongoing issues started yesterday at about 7:52pm, according to the system dashboard.
* The following consumer  services were affected at post time:
* “Users may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service,” reads the description.
* These developer services are having issues as well:
* Apple says that “some users are affected.”
* For what it’s worth, our own Sebastien personally has had problems with Apple Music playback stopping at random in the past 48 hours. I haven’t experienced problems with Apple Music, but App Store has been offline for me the whole morning.
* Are you affected by these issues, and which ones?
* Let us know in the comments.
