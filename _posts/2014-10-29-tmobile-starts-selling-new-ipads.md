* Keeping true to its promise, T-Mobile, the nation’s fourth-largest carrier, on Wednesday announced that customers can now buy Apple’s iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 in participating T-Mobile stores and online. The new tablets are available in Wi-Fi-only and cellular flavors and in all three colors.
* The top-of-the-line iPad Air 2 model with 128 gigabytes of storage is not yet available, leaving early adopters to choose between 16GB and 64GB iPad Air 2 models. The iPad mini 3 is available in 16/64/128GB storage flavors.
* The new tablets are available with $0 down for Simple Choice plan customers with monthly payments. As a reminder, customers can add a tablet and match the data on their Simple Choice voice plan, up to five gigabytes per month, for just $10 more per month, per line.
* To buy your iPad online from T-Mobile, go here.
* Outspoken T-Mobile CEO John Legere said yesterday that iPhones now account for 20 percent of T-Mobile’s smartphone base while hinting that his company saw unusual demand for the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 6 model.
* The Apple SIM introduced in the cellular versions of the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 allows customers to switch seamlessly between data providers, with some caveats. Because not all carriers are playing ball, Legere recommends that would-be shoppers pick up their new iPads through Apple, and activate them with T-Mobile.
