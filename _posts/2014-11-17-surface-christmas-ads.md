* Software giant Microsoft is no stranger to Apple bashing. Every once in a while, the Redmond giant take aim at Apple’s iPad tablets and MacBook Air ultra-thin notebooks by putting out aggressively conceived television commercials for its Surface tablets.
* Just in time for the looming holiday shopping season, Microsoft started airing a brand new Surface Pro ad that argues that its tablet convertible with a kickstand, keyboard cover and desktop apps is a better deal than the MacBook Air.
* Featuring Christmas theme and a matching song, the 30-second ad titled “Winter Wonderland” celebrates the Surface’s competitive features such as its detachable keyboard, a pen and kickstand and desktop apps such as Adobe Photoshop, Office and Windows.

* The Surface Pro 3 is “the tablet that can replace your laptop,” concludes the ad.
* Earlier this month, Microsoft aired an ad that pitted Lenovo’s Yoga 3 Pro convertible to the MacBook Air. Given the amount of Apple bashing in Microsoft’s ads, it came something as a surprise that the company would actually advertise for Apple with a recent Skype ad that features an orchestra managed by a remote conductor using Skype instances running on a bunch of MacBook Pros.
* What would you rather have under a Christmas tree, Microsoft’s tablet convertible or Apple’s MacBook Air?
