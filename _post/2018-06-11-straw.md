* If the iPhone or iPad that you use to listen to your favorite media happens to be jailbroken on iOS 11, then you may want to check out a new free jailbreak tweak called Straw by iOS developer Jake Kaslewicz.
* This tweak acts as your own personal song announcer by presenting a banner at the top of your display every time a new track starts playing.
* As shown in the screenshot examples above, Straw works with both the stock Music app and third-party alternatives like Spotify or Soundcloud. The banner itself shows  information about both the new song and the app that’s playing it.
* Straw adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can mess with a few settings:

* Here, you can:
* The developer incorporates a convenient Respring button at the bottom of the preference pane that you can use to save your changes upon modifying Straw’s settings.
* While persistent song-change notifications won’t be for everyone, they can be useful if you listen to radio stations and favor a quick way of discerning what’s playing without having to do a lot of legwork on your own.
* If you’d like to try Straw for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 11 devices only.
