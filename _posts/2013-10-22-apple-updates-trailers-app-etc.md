* Earlier today, Apple announced that it would be updating 20 of its apps for iOS and Mac. We’ve already covered a number of these updates, including those for the iWork and iLife suites, and now it’s time for some iOS-specific apps.
* Trailers, Podcasts, and Find My iPhone have each been updated for iOS 7. They have all been redesigned to match the new iOS with flatter UI elements and thinner fonts, and we have screenshots and download links after the fold…

* The Podcasts update is easily the largest of the 3, bringing the app to version 2. The update not only introduces a stunning, all-new design for iOS 7, but it adds a number of other improvements as well like a redesigned Top Charts section.
* Designed for iOS 7 • Podcasts has a beautiful new look and feel that fits right in with iOS 7 • The Podcasts Store is now located in the Featured tab, making it easier than ever to discover great podcasts • The new Search tab makes finding podcasts in the Podcasts Store fast and simple • Top Charts now shows podcasts and episodes in a simple list, so it’s even easier to see what’s popular • You can now view your stations as a list of episodes, or group them by podcast
* Stay up to date • Podcasts now automatically update with new episodes — even while the app is not open • Choose how often the Podcasts app checks for updates to get the latest episodes as soon as they become available • iCloud now keeps your subscriptions, stations, and play position in sync with iTunes and Apple TV
* This version of Podcasts also includes improvements to responsiveness and playback performance.
