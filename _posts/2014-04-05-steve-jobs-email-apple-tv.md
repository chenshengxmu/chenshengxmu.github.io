* We’re only a few days in, but we’ve already learned a lot from the Apple-Samsung patent trial. With it being a legal proceeding, the public is given access to information it wasn’t previously privi’ed to by way of executive testimonies, corporate emails and other evidence.
* In fact, earlier today a particularly interesting email surfaced from former Apple CEO Steve Jobs. The document, which was submitted as evidence in the case, features a list of things Jobs wanted to discuss at the company’s 2010 ‘top 100’ meeting, including the Apple TV…
* First of all, what is a ‘Top 100’ meeting? According to former Apple employees, the company hosts a meeting every year featuring its top 100 executives, managers and other staffers. These meetings are extremely secretive, and often include discussion of new products.
* Now, about that email. The Verge has posted the entire thing here, in PDF form, but we’re going to be specifically looking at the Apple TV section. Jobs outlined a total of 11 talking points in the message, each with a few bullet points, and the Apple TV is item number 8.

* Apple has mentioned the ‘magic wand’ several times in previous patent applications. We’ve covered two filings that specifically talk about it here and here, and both describe the wand as a Wii-like TV remote with built in fingerprint sensors for loading custom user profiles.
* So is this so-called ‘wand’ still bouncing around Apple’s R&D labs? It’s tough to say. The company is believed to be working on new TV hardware with support for gaming, and a device like this seems like it’d be perfect. But there has been no mention of it in recent reports.
* Anyway, make sure you stay tuned to iDB for more coverage on the Apple-Samsung trial, as we’re likely to see a lot more of these kinds of documents come to light—oh, and some $2 billion in damages hangs in the balance. The trial is expected run for the next 3-4 weeks.
