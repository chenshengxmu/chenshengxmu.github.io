* It’s hard to believe, but it’s almost been two weeks since Pangu surprised us all, providing a jailbreak for iOS 8. Since that day, we’ve seen numerous updates and releases to fix bugs and address other lingering issues.
* Many of you, though, are still waiting for an OS X version of the iOS 8 jailbreak. From the looks of things, the OS X jailbreak is still a little ways off. Pangu is currently working on a 0.4 release of its Windows tool, which will drop shortly after the 0.3 update was released to fix overheating issues in 32-bit devices.
* Pangu8 untether 0.3 fix the issue for launchd draining cpu. Also 0.4 will coming soon to fix the safari bug.

* Quite a few users are reporting crashes with Safari related to playing video, even after the 0.3 update. Pangu says that a fix for it will come soon with the 0.4 release.
* Besides Safari issues, some users are reporting problems with rebooting. For those on 0.3 experiencing issues with reboot, the team states that this can be caused by a backup restore. Reboot loops can also be caused by incompatible tweaks, or other issues unrelated to the untether and/or Cydia.
* For users who stuck at reboot after install 0.3, the issue is actually caused by backup restore. Read notice at http://t.co/pTo3gCrdmg

* At any rate, it unfortunately appears that the wait for an OS X version of Pangu isn’t in the immediate cards. Pangu has stated in the past that only after the Windows version is stable will they focus their efforts on OS X.
* With that in mind, it may be wise to consider using our virtual machine tutorial. In it, we discuss how to jailbreak iOS 8 on OS X using a virtual machine running Windows. It’s free, easy to setup, and relatively painless.
* What has been your experience with Pangu 0.3 thus far? Are you finding it to be stable, or are you anticipating the 0.4 release? Sound off down below in the comments.
