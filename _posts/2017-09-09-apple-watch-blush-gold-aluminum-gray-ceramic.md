* According to the iOS 11 GM firmware leaks that are making rounds on the web, Apple could be readying two new case materials and color finishes for Apple Watch, one referred to as Blush Gold and clad in aluminum and the other a new Gray ceramic material.
* The Blush Gold colorway is likely destined for the aluminum Sport models while the new Gray ceramic case could replace the existing white ceramic Apple Watch Edition, or join the lineup.

* A leaked iOS 11 Golden Master candidate is a gift that keeps on giving: among other things, it includes a nice photo (embedded below) showing what appears to be an LTE-enabled Apple Watch with a red Digital Crown.

* It’s unclear if these new materials and colorways will be added to the existing Apple Watch Series 1 and 2 models. I’m guessing these are for the upcoming Apple Watch Series 3 models because the Blush Gold model would be a nice companion to the OLED iPhone, which itself should come in a new copper-like Blush Gold shade.
* At any rate, these two Apple Watch color and casing options are likely to make an appearance next week at Apple’s event scheduled for Tuesday, September 12, at the Steve Jobs Theater.
