* Good news for all of you Mac-using jailbreakers out there that updated to Mountain Lion today. The Dev Team has just confirmed that the new OS is compatible with RedSn0w.
* The Team does have a few instructions, though, for the folks that updated. So if you have installed Mountain Lion, and you plan on using the utility, you should read this…
* From The Dev Team blog:
* “Update #1 7/25/12: redsn0w is compatible with today’s retail release of Mountain Lion OS X 10.8. Until we start using an official developer ID for it (!), you’ll need to use the new Ctrl-Click-Open security bypass the first time you run it after downloading.”
* Other than that, you shouldn’t have any problems with RedSn0w in OS X 10.8.
* Remember, you can always find the latest version of RedSn0w on our Downloads page. And we also have a step-by-step tutorial on how to use it.
