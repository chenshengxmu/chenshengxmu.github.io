* Following the release of the updated PwnageTool 4.3.2 jailbreak tool, the iPhone Dev Team has also pushed out an update to the UltraSn0w unlock in Cydia.
* UltraSn0w 1.2.2 has been released to support the new iOS 4.3.2 firmware, as the previous version of UltraSn0w (1.2.1) was broken in iOS 4.3.2. Please note, this will only work for the older iPhone 4 baseband 1.59.00, and iPhone 3G/3GS  basebands 4.26.08, 5.11.07, 5.12.01, 5.13.04, and 6.15.00. It can not unlock newer basebands since there is currently no unlock available.
* The Dev Team has provided the following information on their blog…
* “Note that there’s a corresponding update to ultrasn0w, which has been bumped up to v1.2.2 to get along with iOS 4.3.2 (the ultrasn0w update does not include any new baseband support!). Please reboot your iPhone using the normal “slide to power off” swipe after installing ultrasn0w 1.2.2.”
* Check out our tutorial on how to unlock your iPhone with the new UltraSn0w tool! Make sure to use PwnageTool or Sn0wBreeze if you want to preserve your baseband for UltraSn0w.
