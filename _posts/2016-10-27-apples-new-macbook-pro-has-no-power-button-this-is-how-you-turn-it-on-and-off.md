* Apple today refreshed its Mac notebook lineup with all-new 13 and 15-inch models that have Touch Bar and Touch ID in place of the hardware function keys row, among other new features. It’s a stellar feature that I can’t wait to use.
* According to Apple, the Touch Bar is meant to replace the function keys “that have long occupied the top of your keyboard with something much more versatile and capable.” I’m sold on the new Touch Bar, but where did the dedicated Power button go and how exactly do you turn this thing on now?
* According to The Verge’s Dieter Bohn, the new MacBook Pro now automatically powers on when you open it. And when you want to turn it off, you just hold down the Touch ID button found at the rightmost side of the Touch Bar.
* So technically, Touch ID is the power button.
* This bit about Touch Bar is also interesting:
* What you might not have gathered from the keynote is that it has a matte finish, which makes the buttons on it somehow feel a little more physical. It’s bright, but not so bright that it distracts—it seems to be about on par with the brightness of the backlit keyboard.
* Pretty neat, no?
