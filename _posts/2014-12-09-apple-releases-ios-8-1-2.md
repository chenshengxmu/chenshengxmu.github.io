* Apple has released iOS 8.1.2 this afternoon with a handful of bug fixes and other improvements. Specifically, the release notes say the update addresses an issue where ringtones purchased through the iTunes Store may have disappeared from users’ devices.
* You can access the new firmware over the air via Settings > General > Software Update, or via iTunes by connecting your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to a computer. But as usual, we recommend that users who are jailbroken, or plan to jailbreak, avoid the update for now.
* Today’s release comes three weeks after Apple pushed out iOS 8.1.1 to the public, which also brought about various bug fixes and a patch for the Pangu jailbreak. The software has since been exploited by the TaiG jailbreak, but it’s possible that today’s release kills it as well.

* Again, unless you’re experiencing the aforementioned ringtone problem, there’s no need to rush to update here—it’s a minor release. Apple has seeded a beta version of iOS 8.2 to developers, and we expect that to be far more significant in terms of new features and changes.
* For those looking to update, 8.1.2 is compatible with the iPhone 4s and newer, the iPad 2 and newer, and the fifth generation iPod touch. You can use one of the methods mentioned above, or grab the firmware from our Downloads page and reference step 4 of this tutorial for help.
* Stay tuned.
