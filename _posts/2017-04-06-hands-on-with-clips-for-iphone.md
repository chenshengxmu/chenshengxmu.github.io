* Apple today released Clips, its brand new social video editing app that was previewed on March 21 as part of the company’s Spring product refresh. Available at no charge on App Store, Clips comes with some interesting features, like voice-activated captions, effects, emoji, animated speech bubbles, motion backgrounds, built-in soundtracks and more.
* After spending some time with Clips, our own video editor Andrew O’Hara has created a video walkthrough showcasing just how easy it is to create fun videos that are sharable on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social networks.
* Here’s our hands-on with Clips.
