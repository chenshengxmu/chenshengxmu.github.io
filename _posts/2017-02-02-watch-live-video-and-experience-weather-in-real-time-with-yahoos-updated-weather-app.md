* Apple hasn’t been using Yahoo for weather data in its stock app since iOS 8, but I still keep Yahoo Weather on my iPhone. That’s because to me, Yahoo Weather is the most beautifully designed and most comprehensive piece of weather software I’ve used on mobile thus far. Today, the failed Internet pioneer has pushed a nice little update to Yahoo Weather for iPhone and iPad, which now provides real time weather data along with live video of current weather conditions for select cities.
* To access featured live weather, tap the app’s hamburger menu in the top left corner to reveal a side panel. The settings interface has been refreshed, too, with a toggle for turning live video on and off and another one to prevent the app from downloading live videos when the device is connected to the Internet through a cellular network.
* Almost forgot: the app allows you to enjoy user-submitted images of cities in widescreen mode: just turn your device upside down and the app adjusts the UI accordingly.
* Sadly, Yahoo Weather currently does not support 3D Touch.
* Grab Yahoo Weather from App Store at no charge.
