* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Colossatron: Massive World Threat. For the next 7 days, you can pick up the destructive strategy game for free on both iPhone and iPad, a solid savings of $1.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* Colossatron is developer Halfbrick’s creative spin on a match-three game. Amid frenetic, explosive battlegrounds, attach colorful weaponry to a roving monstrosity and enhance its destructive power. The easy-to-understand gameplay and cleverly designed matching and upgrade mechanics reward careful, strategic play. With quirky humor and thoughtful attention to detail, Colossatron is an expertly crafted and accessible delight.
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Colossatron: Massive World Threat is available in the App Store for free (with some IAPs).
