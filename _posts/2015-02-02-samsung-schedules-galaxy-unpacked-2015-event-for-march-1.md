* The South Korean consumer electronics giant, Samsung, today announced that it will be holding its annual ‘Galaxy Unpacked’ event next month, as reported by the SamMobile blog.
* Titled ‘Galaxy Unpacked 2015,’ the event is scheduled for March 1, coinciding with Mobile World Congress which runs March 2-5 in Barcelona, Spain.
* Of course, we fully expect the Galaxy S6, or whatever it’s called, to go head-to-head against Apple’s latest iPhones. The invites have gone out to select members of the press and feature black background, what appears to be a profile of a curved device and the “What’s Next” tagline tease.
* The company traditionally uses the Unpacked events to announce new smartphones and tablets. With the rumor-mill calling for an early-2015 launch of the Galaxy S6, it’s fairly certain to assume that Samsung is moving to release its flagship smartphone sooner than later.

* The slightly curved appearance of the handset is corroborated by the purported manufacturing 3D model posted on the Chinese social network Weibo two weeks ago and relayed by the French blog NowhereElse.fr (Google Translate). Note that the curvature could be the result of a camera bulge on the back.
* Just three days ago, NowhereElse.fr published (Google Translate) alleged manufacturing blueprints suggesting the S6 will be slightly larger and a bit thinner than the S5, but still thicker than the Galaxy A range.
* Specifically, the S6 should measure 142mm high by 72.5mm wide and 8.1mm thick. By comparison, the Galaxy A7 and the iPhone 6 have a  profile measuring 6.3mm and 6.9mm thick, respectively.

* It’s fair to say that the Galaxy S5 wasn’t as successful as Samsung was hoping for, even less so after Apple released its larger-screened iPhones. Profits of the South Korean firm’s mobile division have fallen off the cliff as a result of the iPhone 6 and Chinese makers like Xiaomi which make inexpensive phones that are as good, or better, as Samsung’s.
* If you trust the rumor-mill, the S6 is going to feature an improved fingerprint sensor based on touching rather than swiping, like Touch ID, as well as specs bump up across the board.

* As per Qualcomm, the company will be likely using its own chip inside the Galaxy S6, a 64-bit Exynos 7420 with 3GB of RAM, rather than the 64-bit Snapdragon 810 which is plagued with overheating issues.
* Other hardware features of the S6 are said to include a Super AMOLED display measuring between 5.1 and 5.5 inches diagonally and sporting a resolution of 2,560-by-1,440 pixels, as well as a 20-megapixel camera out the back with 4K video capture and a five-megapixel shooter out the front.
* Last but not least, the flagship smartphone should combine LED-flash and a heart rate sensor on the back into a single unit and be housed inside an all-metal enclosure perhaps sandwiched between two pieces of glass, like the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s.
