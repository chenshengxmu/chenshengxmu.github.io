* BiteSMS is by far the best jailbreak tweak for the stock Messages app that gets regular updates to make it the perfect tweak. It comes packed with a bunch of new features but it’s best known for its Quick Reply and Quick Compose features. With BiteSMS, you can quickly reply to a received message from anywhere within iOS. Tapping on the Notification banner or swiping a notification in the Lock screen will display a pop up where you can type in your reply.
* To quickly compose a message, you can press one of the volume buttons or tap on the volume HUD to bring up the quick compose interface. Other than this, BiteSMS provides various other features such as scheduled SMS messages, passcode lock, templates, contact pictures, notification privacy and more.
* BiteSMS is available for free in Cydia but after 7 days of free trial, you’ll start seeing advertising banners. To get rid of ads, you can purchase a lifetime license for $7.99. BiteSMS supports devices running iOS 5, 6 or 7.

* If you’re a Mac user, you can easily use iMessage on your computer and easily stay connected with your friends. But what about Windows, Linux or other operating system users? This is where Remote Messages comes into action to save the day. Remote Messages is a browser-based front end for iOS 7 Messages app. The tweak allows you to remotely access your iOS 7 Messages app via your computer and send and receive both iMessage and SMS messages directly from your browser. Whatever message you send from your computer will be automatically synchronized to your iOS 7 device.

Tapping on the notification banner when a new message arrives will bring up the tweak’s interface with the recipient and app name, the message and a text box where you can quickly type in your reply.

* Brevity is an add-on for the stock Messages app that allows you to quickly send a response with the tap of a button. Users can easily create a custom made shortcut or response from the tweak’s preferences and it will take the place of the “Send” button in the Messages app when the text box is left empty. Tapping on the button will quickly send the custom message without requiring you to type anything. This is quite useful when you use the same response frequently in your messages. Shortcuts can be anything ranging from plain text to Emoji or Unicode characters. Brevity costs $0.99 in Cydia and is compatible with iOS 7 devices:

* One of the features that iOS 7 Messages app lacks is the ability to view statistics of your iMessage and SMS messages. SMS Stats 2 seeks to overcome this problem by allowing you to view the total amount of iMessage or SMS messages sent and received, as well as the combined amount till date or for the past 28 days. Statistics include total messages, sent messages, and received messages. An ‘S’ button will appear right next to the compose button which allows you to access the statistics. To access the statistics for an individual conversation, open the contact’s messages, tap on ‘Contact’ and press the ‘S’ button. SMS Stats 2 is compatible with iOS 7 devices and is available for free in Cydia.

* TypeStatus is availabe for free in Cydia and supports iOS 5, 6 and 7 devices.

* There are many quick reply tweaks available in Cydia but Interactive Message Notifications is quite unique in the sense that it brings the iOS 8 style quick reply to iOS 7. When you receive a new message, swipe down the notification banner to open a text box to type in your response and quickly reply the recipient from anywhere within iOS without having to open the Messages application. I tested the tweak with Whatsapp and it worked successfully. If you want to experience iOS 8’s quick reply on iOS 7, you should try out Interactive Message Notifications. The tweak is available in Cydia for $0.99.

* If you have a lot of conversations going on at once, you may want to try out MessageSwiper7. A simple, yet useful tweak, that allows users to quickly swipe and switch from one conversation to another without having to go back to the Messages main menu. You can choose to swipe left or right from the center of the conversation or the edge. You’ll also get a small preview of the other conversation when you swipe halfway.

* If you frequently use the Messages app to text or iMessage your friends, you must have noticed by now that there’s no way you can mark a message as read or unread. With the ‘Unread‘ jailbreak tweak, you can tap and hold on a message to mark it as unread. Similarly, if a message is unread, tapping and holding on it will mark it as read. You can download Unread for free via Cydia’s BigBoss repository.

* Last in the list is CamText, an interesting tweak that transforms the background of the Messages app into a live camera background. This can be quite useful when you’re texting while walking in the street. You can also adjust the transparency of the Messages app background from the tweak’s preferences pane. You can find it for $1.50 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* These are the best jailbreak tweaks that will improve your iOS messaging experience. Is there any tweak that we might have missed and deserves to be on the list? Lets us know in the comments section below.
