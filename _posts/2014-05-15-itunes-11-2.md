* To go along with the just-released OS X Mavericks 10.9.3 Software Update, Apple has also issued a second major update to iTunes 11. The new version 11.2 is now available for download and includes several improvements to the in-app podcast browsing experience.
* For starters, there are now all-new Unplayed and Feed tabs which collate episodes you haven’t listened to yet and new ones that have become available.
* iTunes now lets you save a podcast episode to keep on your computer and resolves a few annoying issues, including one where Genius would hang when updating itself. Jump past the fold for the full breakdown…
* iTunes 11.2 changelog:
* Improved Podcast Browsing
* • Quickly find episodes you haven’t listened to in the new Unplayed tab • Browse episodes that are available to download or stream in the Feed tab • Save your favorite episodes to keep them on your computer • Episodes can now be automatically deleted after you play them
* I’m really glad that Apple has finally resolved an issue where iTunes would become unresponsive when updating Genius, which has happened to me on a regular basis. The update also improves overall performance and stability of the app.
* Detailed information about the security content of this update can be found in Apple’s support document. iTunes 11.2 is available under the Updates tab in the Mac App Store.
* The app can also be downloaded straight from Apple’s website.
* Apple recommends folks use its own Podcasts for iOS 2.1 app when syncing episodes. Of course, power users typically bypass iTunes/Podcasts altogether and instead opt for some of the best third-party apps, such as Vemedio’s Instacast.
* Earlier this morning, Apple released OS X Mavericks 10.9.3 Software Update which includes the previously published Safari 7.0.3 update.
* Have you noticed any new issues with iTunes 11.2?
