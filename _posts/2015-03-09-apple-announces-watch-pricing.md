* We’re watching the “Spring Forward” event currently underway in San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Center for the Performing Arts and CEO Tim Cook has revealed that the aluminum Sport edition of the wrist-worn device will cost $349 for the smaller 38mm model and $399 for the larger 42mm one.
* The other model, the stainless steel Apple Watch, will set you back between $549 and $1,049 for the smaller 38mm version, depending on your choice of wrist band. The larger 42mm version will set you back $599 to $1,099 — again, depending on your band of choice.
* As for the Apple Watch Edition, it’s going to start at a whopping $10,000 and all the way up to $17,000. Quantities and availability will be limited.
* So, once again to make it really clear:
* Mind you, these are U.S. prices.
* “Conceived, designed and developed as a singular product, Apple Watch merges hardware and software like never before,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s senior vice president of Design.

* The company has underscored that its wearable device keeps time to within 50 milliseconds of the Universal Time Standard and can be personalized with watch faces ranging from traditional analog such as the Chronograph face, to the information-rich Modular face, or beautifully animated butterflies and jellyfish on the Motion face.
* “Apple Watch begins a new chapter in the way we relate to technology and we think our customers are going to love it,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, in a media release linked below.
