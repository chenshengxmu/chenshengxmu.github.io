* Earlier today we did a post about Whited00r, a custom firmware built for older Apple ARM6 devices. It includes built-in tweaks and gives you the option to remove unwanted features like Spotlight to make your device faster.
* Whited00r has been out for a while, but it’s kind of flown under the radar. There’s still millions of these older devices floating around, so we figured we’d give folks an easy walkthrough on how to install Whited00r on your older iPhone or iPod touch…
* It’s not like normal jailbreak software. Typically you use a program like RedSn0w or PwnageTool to jailbreak an IPSW file, and then load it onto your device. But Whited00r’s already jailbroken, so all it really takes is restoring the custom firmware.
* While you can certainly sift through our jailbreak and download pages to find the appropriate resources to jailbreak your device, Whited00r is easy to install and adds a lot of useful features like multitasking to your older device. How easy are we talking here? Check out the tutorial below:
* Important Note: Compatible devices are iPod touch 1G and 2G, and the iPhone 2G and 3G. Whited00r is not compatible with any other products.
* Step 1: Make sure your device is up to date by plugging it into your computer and firing up iTunes. In the iDevice’s iTune page, click Check for Updates.
* Step 2: Once your device software is up to date, download the Whited00r firmware here. I suggest that you download it to your desktop so it’s easy to locate.
* Step 3: After the file is done downloading, navigate back to your device’s iTunes page. Hold down the option key (shift for Windows users) and click Restore.
* Step 4: A window should pop up allowing you to browse your hard drive. Select the Whited00r firmware you just downloaded.
* Step 5: Installation can take up to 15 minutes or more, so don’t freak out if it seems slow. Once completed, it is recommended by the developer that you choose the “Set up as new iPhone/iPod” option, rather than restoring from a previous backup.
* That’s all there is to it! You should now have a modified version of iOS on your device, along with the infamous Cydia icon. If you run into a problem, just put your iDevice in DFU mode (hold down home and power buttons for 10 seconds, then release power button and hold home for 10 seconds) and start the process over.
* If you really feel like you’re in trouble, you can always restore back to your original iOS firmware.
* Any questions?
