* Any time you plug your locked iPhone or iPad into a power source, the screen lights up with an over-sized battery indicator that gives you a brief summary and visual representation of your remaining percentage.
* With a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed PersonalEcate by iOS developer CydiaGeek, you can customize the string of text that typically appears underneath the battery indicator icon.
* Shown above, you can see an example of how the tweak works. We’ve replaced the “X% Charged” text string with something a little more personalized. You can set any custom text you want – it doesn’t need to match our example.
* PersonalEcate adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* The developer includes a respring button at the bottom of the preference pane so that you can save your changes any time you adjust the settings.
* For the most part, PersonalEcate doesn’t have anything to offer besides personal aesthetics, so it’s more of a novelty tweak than anything else. If you’d like to give the tweak a try, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.
* As of this writing, PersonalEcate supports jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices. CydiaGeek says he’s working on iOS 11 support and will add it in a future update.
* What will you change your charging text string to after installing PersonalEcate? Share in the comments below!
