* With a larger of the two jumbo-sized iPhones rumored to arrive later this year rocking a massive 5.5-inch screen, Apple’s adamant to buy huge amounts of thin sapphire laminates, likely to strengthen the handset’s cover glass. We know Apple invested nearly $500 million in high-tech furnaces and equipment for its Arizona sapphire plant.
* The firm is operating the facility in partnership with GT Advanced.
* We’ve also known that Apple and GT have signed an exclusive multi-year agreement and now Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth has gone on the record claiming that Apple has acquired three-year supply of sapphire screens…
* Shuttleworth said in an interview with GigaOm:
* Apple just snapped up the entire 3-year supply of the same sapphire display we wanted for the Edge.
* He was referring to the Ubuntu Edge, a flagship handset which broke crowdfunding records, but never got made.
* A report earlier this month looked into Apple’s equipment purchases for the Mesa plant, estimating the facility should produce at least a hundred million five-inch sapphire screens for the next iPhone.
* Some watchers have mentioned twice as much sapphire screens.
* Corroborating rumors published by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, a report earlier this week by The South China Morning Post asserted that both a 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch iPhone model will use sapphire crystal for screen protection.
* Contradicting the claim, Taiwan’s Economic Daily News said today that only the bigger model will use sapphire-strengthened screens via Apple’s partnership with GT Advanced. This phablet-style device apparently won’t use the iPhone branding, if Economic Daily News is to be trusted.
* Citing Apple’s reliance on the expensive gemstone for cover glass protection, the story also speculated that supply of the device would be limited at launch.
* Apple currently uses sapphire crystal to protect its Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5s and the iSight camera lens on iOS devices from scratches, nicks and dings.
* Looks like sapphire protection is going to be one of the defining design features of the next iPhone.
