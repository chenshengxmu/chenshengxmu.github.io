* Yahoo today issued an interesting update to its native Mail application for the iPhone and iPad which replicates a handy feature we first saw in the stock Mail app in iOS 8.
* Now available in the App Store, the refreshed Yahoo Mail version 3.3.2 includes the obligatory bug fixes and performance improvements, in addition to an iPad-specific feature which allows you to minimize the compose window when you need to look something up, just like Mail in iOS 8.
* This is tremendously useful when multitasking while composing an email. Often times, when I write an email I need to look an article online to attach the URL.
* Now I can just swipe down on the compose header to minimize the window and safely switch to another app knowing my in-progress message is being kept intact.
* When I feel ready to continue writing, Iâ€™ll just tap or swipe up to pick up right where I left off. This is fairly similar, if not identical, to the stock Mail app in iOS 8, as evidenced in the WWDC 2014 below.
* Version 3.2.2 changelog:
* Download Yahoo Mail free in the App Store.
* The universal 39.2MB app requires an iOS device running iOS 7.0 or later.
* [App Store]
