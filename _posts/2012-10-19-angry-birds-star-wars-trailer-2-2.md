title: New Angry Birds Star Wars trailer features Princess Leia
---
* Rovio’s so far teased Angry Birds Star Wars twice (here and here). This brand new mashup resulting from a partnership with toy maker Hasbro could be a smash hit, if previous Angry Birds games are anything to go by. Today, the Finnish developer behind the franchise released a new trailer that features Princess Leia and the pig-ified Storm Trooper helmet, have a look.
* I’m a big fan of both the Angry Birds series and Star Wars. It goes without saying that I cannot wait to see what Rovio’s been up to with this one. The game arrives November 8 to iOS and Android, in addition to versions for Windows Phone, Kindle Fire, Mac and PCs running Windows 8. Say what you will, but Rovio sure knows how to milk the franchise, but not at the expense of gameplay creativity…
* From YouTube description:
* The wait for Angry Birds Star Wars is even shorter than Luke Skywalker!
* …but don’t just pace around, counting the days until November 8. Our Angry Birds page is full of comics, fan art and other videos, just like this one!
* So, sit back, paint yourself gold like C-3PO, and utter the immortal line “Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1” – Angry Birds Star Wars will be here before you know it!

* In your view, is Angry Birds Star Wars going to be worth your latte?
