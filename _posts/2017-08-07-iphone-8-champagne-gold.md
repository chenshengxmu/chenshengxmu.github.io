* MyDrivers today shared images of what appear to be purported iPhone 8 dummy units that originally surfaced on Chinese microblogging service Weibo, depicting three possible colorways for the upcoming OLED-based iPhone: White, Black and Champagne Gold.
* The latter option is “closer in copper” in its color and visually similar to Rose Gold devices.
* UPDATE: Here are a few more images, via leak aggregator SlashLeaks.

* We cannot vouch for the authenticity of these photographs, but they do seem to depict dummy units rather than actual devices so we’re re-posting them here for the discussion’s sake.

* According to prolific smartphone leaker Benjamin Geskin, iPhone 8 could include a fourth, mirror-like reflective version which hasn’t been used for iPhones before. Seen below is a side-by-side comparison between that standard Black color option and the new Copper Gold.

* The backside includes minimal bezels around the sides and a vertically aligned dual-camera system with what appears to be LED flash built into the bulge, between the two lenses.
* As we said before, iPhone 8 is thought to come outfitted with 3D sensors on both its front and rear for features like enhanced augmented reality, laser autofocus and more.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the OLED iPhone would offer fewer casing colors than the LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models in order to “maintain its boutique image”.
* What would be your preferred color option for iPhone 8?
