* Well, that’s all folks. The ‘historic’ iPhone 6 event has come, and gone. All announcements have been made, all products unveiled, and we finally got to see what was in the mysterious white structure Apple built outside of the Flint Center.
* A lot has happened in the last 12 hours, and we understand that it might have been difficult to keep track of everything. So, as usual, we’ve put together this awesome roundup for you of everything important that happened at today’s event.

* I don’t think there were very many surprises in terms of the new iPhone models. That being said, Apple still introduced two fantastic handsets today with larger, higher resolution displays, faster processors, NFC technology, and much more.

* After years of speculation, Apple finally announced its intentions for the mobile payment space. It wants to use a combination of NFC, Touch ID and other technologies to make paying for things with your iPhone, online and in stores, safe and easy.

* It’s official, Apple is in the watch business, introducing today the [aptly enough] Apple Watch. The accessory comes in 3 collections, two sizes, 6 finishes, with several band choices, and aims to make powerful technology more personal and accessible.

* At the end of today’s event, Apple brought out rock band U2 to perform a single from its new album “Songs of Innocence.” It then announced that it would be giving the album to all iTunes users for free. Learn more about this and other stuff below.
* And that should just about do it. We’d like to thank you for choosing to hang out with us today, and we hope you had as much fun as we did. Make sure you stay tuned to iDB throughout the coming weeks and months, as we continue the coverage.
