* The Apple TV 2 jailbreak for the 5.0 firmware (iOS 5.1) is finally among us, and that means that we get to experience jailbreaking with Apple’s brand new Apple TV interface.
* Although this is a tethered jailbreak, it really doesn’t get any easier than Seas0npass. Step inside to see why this is one of the best jailbreak tools across any iOS device…
* Step 1: Plug your power cable and USB micro cable in. Connect your USB micro cable to your computer.
* Step 2: Download Seas0nPass, and install. Run Seas0nPass, and it will create custom firmware, and guide you through jailbreaking your device including DFU mode instructions.
* Step 3: Perform a tethered boot from Seas0npass’ main screen.
* Step 4: Verify that the FireCore logo is on your Apple TV’s interface.
* Jailbreaking an Apple TV with Seas0nPass is simply a joy, and even though it’s a tethered jailbreak, rarely if ever will you need to perform a tethered boot. That’s because in most cases the device is always supplied with power, unlike an iPhone, iPad, etc.
