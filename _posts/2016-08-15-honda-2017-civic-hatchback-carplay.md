* After rolling out CarPlay in the 2016 Accord and Civic and in the 2017 Ridgeline, Japanese car manufacturer Honda today confirmed that Apple’s iPhone-connected infotainment system will be returning in the new five-door 2017 Civic Hatchback, arriving in North America this fall.
* All five trims of the vehicle—the LX, Sport, EX, EX-L and Sport Touring—can be outfitted with CarPlay, but only the Sport Touring trim will include CarPlay by default, in addition to Android Auto support, Honda Sensing features and LED headlights, with other available features like heated rear seats, remote engine start, heated side mirrors and more.
* Vehicles with CarPlay support are listed on Apple’s website.
