* A placeholder listing for a new Apple Files app has briefly appeared on App Store ahead of today’s live-streamed WWDC keynote, as spotted by iOS developer Steven Troughton-Smith late Sunday. It’s surfaced in the Utilities section of App Store and has since been removed.
* No screenshots or the official description were provided.
* The app requires iOS 11 and 64-bit support and is designed for both iPhone and iPad. It sports a blue file folder icon resembling the design for folder icons in macOS. It’s entirely possible that the new Files app is really just a rebranded version of the existing iCloud Drive app.
* It’s unclear if the forthcoming app will be a new stock item in iOS 11 or an optional download. If I had to guess, I’d say it will likely come pre-installed with iOS 11. Since iOS 10, Apple has allowed users to hide most of the stock apps from their Home screen.
* To help users easily re-install any removed stock apps, Apple has provided all of its first-party iOS apps that are removable as downloadable App Store items. iOS 11 will be previewed at WWDC later today along with tvOS 11, watchOS 4 and macOS 10.13.
