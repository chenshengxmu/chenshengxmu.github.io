* As promised, the infamous Dev Team has just released its CLI jailbreak which is compatible with both the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2. It’s still for Mac users only, but it does provide an alternative to the Absinthe app.
* We must warn you though that this isn’t your typical jailbreak software. CLI stands for Command Line Interface, meaning using it isn’t as easy as clicking the “jailbreak” button. It’s definitely not for the feint of heart…
* Here’s how the Dev Team describes its CLI app:
* “The OS X version of the CLI mentioned in the post can be downloaded here. It’s primarily to help us debug specific issues, but tinkerers might like to play around with some of its advanced options!”
* So essentially, the majority of users should stay with Absinthe or wait for the Dev Team to release a new version of RedSn0w. If you’re really interested in trying CLI, stay tuned for our step-by-step guide on how to use it.
