* Countless jailbreak tweaks can help make your iOS 10 device look and feel more like it’s running iOS 11, and now you can add a new free release called NotificationXI by iOS developer Squ1dd13 to that list.
* From the screenshot examples above, you can discern how NotificationXI does away with the two-tone look of iOS 10’s incoming notification banners. Instead, it carries over the headerless single-tone style you would expect to see in iOS 11.
* The tweak also works with the notification banners that show up on the Lock screen and in Notification Center, as shown below:

* Whether you like the look and feel of iOS 11 or not remains to be seen, but NotificationXI does a relatively good job of replicating the look and feel.
* Furthermore, those who stayed on iOS 10 rather than installing iOS 11.1.2 when they had the chance might never get to use an iOS 11 jailbreak. That said, tweaking iOS 10’s appearance to look more like iOS 11 seems to be the next best thing.
* Notably, NotificationXI doesn’t have any options to configure, so it’s a straightforward tweak. Its effects begin to permeate your notification banners from the moment you install the tweak on your device.
* If you’d like to give NotificationXI a try, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. NotificationXI works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* Do you like how iOS 11’s notification banners look more than those found on iOS 10? Share why or why not in the comments section below.
