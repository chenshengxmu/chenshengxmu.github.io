* Lots of new tidbits of information is beginning to surface regarding a potential jailbreak for iOS 8.3 and iOS 8.4, and the future of jailbreaking with iOS 9, which will presumably be released in beta form after the WWDC keynote on Monday, June 8th, 2015.
* iDigitalTimes’ Cammy Harbison’s interview with TaiG member Ray Xie, revealed that the TaiG team is setting its sights on iOS 9 with regard to future jailbreaks. Not long after that interview went live, news began to leak out that Pangu, the other Chinese team responsible for some of the more recent jailbreaks, was preparing a jailbreak release for iOS 8.3 right after the release of iOS 8.4.
* So what’s to make of all of this? Will we actually see an iOS 8.3 jailbreak released publicly? Will we have to wait until iOS 9 officially launches before another jailbreak surfaces? There’s no way to be 100% sure about any of this, especially with the rumored implementation of the so-called rootless security mechanism. But one thing is clear, the interest in jailbreaking—at least from a hacker perspective—is still strong.
* The website Tools4Hack released a report earlier today stating that the iOS 8.3 jailbreak was demonstrated by Pangu at the 2015 Mobile Security Conference (MOSEC) in Shanghai, which Pangu played co-host to. Although we have no way of independently confirming the validity of such a report, Harbison’s own investigative work lends some credence to the possibility of both an iOS 8.3 and iOS 8.4 jailbreak.
* So what can we gather from this? Amidst the confusion, there seems to be some definite smoke around the two most prominent hacking teams in the jailbreak community at present. One, TaiG, says that they are focusing on iOS 9, and the other, Pangu, is apparently claiming that iOS 8.3 is still very much in play as a potential jailbreak recipient.
* You may want to take some of this with a grain of salt, since we haven’t heard anything directly from the horses mouth, but it’s much more hope than we had prior to today, and hope is good.
* What do you think will happen?
