* Amid everything happening with the iOS 11 jailbreak situation as of late, there hasn’t been very much going on in the iOS 10 department. On the other hand, Sticktron changed that over the weekend by releasing G0blin RC2 to jailbreak most iOS 10-3-10.3.3 devices.
* G0blin RC2 comes just two weeks after the launch of G0blin RC1, and it brings a plethora of significant bug fixes and improvements that should appeal to anyone handling a stock iOS 10.3-10.3.3 device.
* Citing the official G0blin web page, RC2 of the tool includes the following changes and improvements:
* Despite what looks like substantial improvements to the G0blin jailbreak, users on Reddit say that RC2 still exhibits the Touch ID problem present in RC1. More specifically, you can’t use it to authenticate yourself in App Store apps.
* RC2 certainly seems more stable than RC1 at first glance, but novice jailbreakers may want to wait a little longer until Sticktron irons out some of the remaining bugs. Then again, whether the Touch ID problem will hinder your usage depends heavily on how you use your device.
* Notably, most jailbreak tweaks that worked on Luca Todesco’s Yalu jailbreak should also work with the G0blin jailbreak considering how there aren’t too many significant changes from iOS 10.2 to iOS 10.3.x.
* If you’re using iOS 11 instead of iOS 10.3-10.3.3, then Electra or LiberiOS might be your best bet for jailbreaking. Even so, we recommend waiting until Saurik updates Cydia and Mobile Substrate for iOS 11 before moving forward.
* Have you jailbroken any of your iOS 10.3-10.3.3 devices with G0blin yet? Share your experience in the comments section below.
