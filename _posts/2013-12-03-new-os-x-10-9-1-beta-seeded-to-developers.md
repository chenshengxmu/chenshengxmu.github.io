* Apple has seeded its latest 10.9.1 beta for OS X developers; this time sporting a build number of 13B40, compared to the 13B35 build released back on November 21. Like build 13B35, this version focuses on Apple Mail, Safari, VoiceOver, and graphics drivers. Check inside for more details, screenshots, and the full release notes.
* This latest update includes the following changes:

* Registered Apple developers who wish to test the latest OS X beta should head over to the Mac Dev Center. There you will find a link to download the 192.62 KB Mavericks Seed Configuration Utility in order to start process. After you do this, youâ€™ll be taken to the Mac App Store downloads page to start the actual download and install process of this latest beta build.
* For me, a user on the standard public release of OS X 10.9, the full download comes in at 243 MB.

* As always, these releases are intended for registered Apple developers. If you happen to be one, you can head over to the dev center to download right now.
