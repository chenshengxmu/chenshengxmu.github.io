* Apple’s in-car entertainment solution, CarPlay, features limited support for third-party applications, ranging from Stitcher and Apple’s own Podcasts to Beats Music, iHeartRadio and Spotify. Previously demoed at WWDC earlier this month, you can now put MLB At Bat on the list of officially supported CarPlay apps, according to Apple’s own CarPlay webpage…
* Noting that MLB At Bat was demoed during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, MacRumors first spotted the inclusion of the MLB At Bat icon on the CarPlay mini site.
* PCMag earlier this month shared its impressions with CarPlay. According to their article, MLB At Bat allows drivers to live-stream a variety of radio stations that broadcast local games. Using MLB At Bat on CarPlay will require a subscription, costing $19.99 for the whole 2014 season or $2.99 per month.
* Support for additional CarPlay apps is coming in the future, as per Apple’s webpage.
* Apple unveiled CarPlay in January with launch support from Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. Other car vendors are slated to gradually roll out CarPlay support across their 2015 lineup.
* CarPlay requires an iPhone 5/5s/5c and iOS 7.1 or later.
* Aftermarket CarPlay solutions from Pioneer and Alpine are available for owners of older vehicles that don’t feature built-in CarPlay integration.
* The free MLB.com At Bat app for the iPhone and iPad is available on the App Store.
