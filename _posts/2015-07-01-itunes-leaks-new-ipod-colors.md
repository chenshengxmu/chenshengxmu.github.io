* Apple yesterday unleashed iTunes 12.2 with Apple Music and Beats 1 integration and as per usual, enthusiasts combing through the installer have managed to find traces of unreleased products.
* Hidden device graphics uncovered by MacRumors depicts new color options for iPods, including a gold iPod nano and a brighter pink iPod shuffle.
* It’s unclear if the unreleased devices are coming, if they might offer only new color options or if a more substantial hardware upgrade is in tow for the aging music player lineup, but additional assets suggest the new colors will be applied across the lineup.
* In addition to a gold iPod nano, the assets suggest that a dark blue variant of the iPod touch and a brighter pink version of the iPod shuffle may be in the works.
* The composite image seen top of post shows up when setting up or restoring an iPod device in iTunes 12.2 on a Mac or Windows PC. For what it’s worth, that image was nowhere to be found in the previous iTunes 12.1.2 version.
* Pierre Dandumont found the additional images suggesting the new colors will be applied to the entire lineup.

* While Apple typically refreshes iPods in September, the firm hasn’t really given its music player lineup much love in quite a while.
* For example, the iPod touch, once lauded as an App Store machine and a handheld gaming device, was last refreshed in June 2014 dropping the 32/64GB models to $249/$299 while introducing a new $199 16GB model.

* Launched in October 2012, the fifth-generation iPod touch runs Apple’s now-outdated A5 processor and has an unimpressive camera.
* The $49 iPod shuffle was last updated nearly two years ago and the iPod nano saw its last significant hardware refresh in September 2012, with a minor September 2013 update seeing only the replacement of the previous Slate colorway with a new Space Gray color option.
* Though there’s always the possibility that Apple may be trolling us, device graphics buried inside iTunes assets has historically provided an accurate depiction of upcoming devices.
* The question is, do you still care about the iPod?
