* The official biography of Steve Jobs is still a few months away, but the new publication date of November 21, 2011 is certainly a lot sooner than the original date of March 2012.
* As a highly anticipated, pre-ordered best seller, the biography has also received its first cover. However, given the book’s tendency to change details pre-launch, we wouldn’t be surprised if a new photo adornes the front page before we get our sticky, little hands on it…
* The cover is suitably understated, featuring a black and white image of Jobs, with the books title above his head.
* Speaking of the title, that’s also gone under the knife, with a new, shorter version now apparently the choice of the publisher. Previously titled, iSteve: a Book of Jobs, then Steve Jobs: A Biography, the book’s new title is just as simplistic as its cover, with a simple ‘Steve Jobs‘ being enough to whet the appetite this time around.
* Title changes aside, the most exciting news without a doubt has to be the new release date. We can’t wait to get our hands on the book, and we’re sure you can’t either.
* Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is available for pre-order now, both in paper and Kindle form.
