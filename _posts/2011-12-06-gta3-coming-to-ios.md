* We’ve known that Rockstar is bringing Grand Theft Auto III to iOS and select Android devices for some time now, but we never knew when exactly we would be able to get our hands on it. That changed today, and we’re all getting a little over-excited at the prospect of playing a game we already loved playing ten years ago.
* As Rockstar announced today, (deep breath) Grand Theft Auto III: 10th Anniversary Edition will go on sale on December 15th. That’s just 9 short days away!
* The developers also announced the final list of compatible devices across both iOS and Android, with things being decidedly simpler on the side of Apple’s hardware…
* If you’re of the iOS variety of gamer, then you’ll need to be toting an iPhone 4 or 4S, an iPod touch 4th generation, or an iPad. The game just will not run an anything other than those 5 devices. You need more power, Cap’n!

* When GTAIII goes on sale on the 15th you’ll only need to pony up $4.99 to play it, which is something of a bargain in our books. Just look at those screenshots, damnit!
* Will you be hitting the refresh button on the App Store come the 15th, or will you, for some unfathomable reason, be giving GTAIII a miss?
