* Apple has officially commented on the ongoing bending iPhone 6 controversy, saying that an iPhone bending with normal use is “extremely rare.” In a quote to the Financial Times, a spokesperson for the company said that only 9 people have complained of the issue since the 6 and 6 Plus went on sale last Friday.
* Here’s Apple full media statement on the matter:
* Our iPhones are designed, engineered and manufactured to be both beautiful and sturdy. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus feature a precision engineered unibody enclosure constructed from machining a custom grade of 6000 series anodized aluminum, which is tempered for extra strength. They also feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high stress locations and use the strongest glass in the smartphone industry. We chose these high-quality materials and construction very carefully for their strength and durability. We also perform rigorous tests throughout the entire development cycle including 3-point bending, pressure point cycling, sit, torsion, and user studies. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus meet or exceed all of our high quality standards to endure everyday, real life use.
* With normal use a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus. As with any Apple product, if you have questions please contact Apple.
* Apple is responding to ongoing controversy over the bendability of its two new iPhones—more specifically the larger iPhone 6 Plus. It started a few days ago with a handful of complaints from 6 Plus owners, who claimed that their handsets became disfigured in their pockets during a normal day of carry and operation.
* On Tuesday, the issue reached viral status (see bendgate) when popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy posted this video of an iPhone 6 Plus being bent by the host’s hands. Some feel that the demonstration is misleading, as he applies significant force to the device, but the clip is now at 24 million views and counting.
* If you feel that your new iPhone has become warped during normal usage, a report from The Next Web suggests you may be able to get it replaced. A support staffer told the site that if it passes an inspection test, an Apple Store genius can opt to swap it out. Keep in mind, though, this is not an official Apple comment.
* After announcing record iPhone sales on Monday, this week has turned into a PR nightmare for Apple, who is also dealing with Wednesday’s 8.0.1 debacle. And despite its statement today, “bendgate” is far from over, as Consumer Reports has announced it’s currently performing extensive tests on the new iPhones.
