title: iPad 2 Supply Already Dwindling?
---
* If you weren’t one of those people that got online at 1 AM this morning to snag an iPad 2, you may be waiting a while. Apple’s second version of its popular tablet went on sale early this morning online, and will be available at 5 PM at retail stores today.
* It appears it didn’t take long for Apple fanatics to snatch up the first round of shippable iPad 2’s. At about 7 AM PST this morning, customers trying to order the new iPad online were met with a 2-3 week ship time.
* People who got their orders in before that, were able to have the product shipped in 3-5 days. After noticing the lengthy ship times, I decided to call my local retailers, and see what would be available for local purchase.
* To my surprise, the wireless dealers I contacted stated they would have limited quantity on hand. They also stated that they wouldn’t have any iPad 2 WiFi only models on hand for the big launch day.
* When Apple announced a ship date of less than 2 weeks after the iPad 2 was made public, I expected them to be a little more prepared. Especially considering that the original iPad, was one of the fastest selling consumer electronic products in history.
* Did you snag an iPad 2 this morning? Will you be venturing out to a retail store today? Let us know below!
