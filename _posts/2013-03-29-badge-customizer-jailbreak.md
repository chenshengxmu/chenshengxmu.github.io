* Today we’re going to be taking a look at Badge Customizer, a new jailbreak tweak that allows you to customize the look of your app icon badges in iOS 6. You can alter their color, size and where they are positioned on your Home screen icons.
* Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Cody, there’s already tweaks out there that do this.” And you’re right. There’s AppTag, and I’m sure a few others. But I don’t know how many of them work with iOS 6. Besides, it never hurts to have options…

* Badge Customizer is as easy to use at it sounds. Once installed, simply pop into your Settings app to start configuring all of the different options. Again, you can completely change the look of your badges, customizing their color, size and position.
* In fact, there’s so many options it’s actually a bit overwhelming. Inside the Badge Color pane you can choose from 15 Blend Modes, and change the color—which is done with 3 RGB sliders—and the alpha. Luckily, there is a handy Preview button.

* In addition to the Badge Color pane, there is also a Badge Size slider, which [obviously] let’s you change the badge’s size, and a Badge Position menu. Here you’ll find 9 options for badge positions including top left, bottom left and middle right.
* I don’t usually keep around customization tweaks, as I have a fairly minimal jailbreak setup. But I’d consider keeping this one. It works great and is extremely stable. If you’d like to try it out, you can find Badge Customizer in BigBoss, for free.
* Have you tried Badge Customizer yet? Be sure to let us know what you think of it in the comments below.
