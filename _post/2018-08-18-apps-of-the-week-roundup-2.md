* This week’s edition of our Apps of the Week roundup includes a sharp-looking task manager, a nostalgic video editor, and a silly dog generator. And as always, we’ve selected two great new games for you to check out.

* They say if you’ve seen one task manager, you’ve seen ’em all. But I don’t think that’s the case. I think this category is very subjective, and all it takes is a slightly different UI or UX approach for a seemingly simple app to change the way you view productivity. All of that being said, meet Task List. It has a very professional (and U-M) looking interface and powerful features like nested tasks, built-in calendars and reminders, notes, and much more.

* Now this isn’t a brand new app, and I’m sure there are several others that offer similar functionality, but if you’ve ever wanted your iPhone videos to have that classic 1980’s VHS-look, check out VHS Camcorder. Features include custom on-screen dates and titles, white noise, audio clipping and other effects that make your videos look and sound like they were shot in the age of analog. Now THIS would be fun to play around with this weekend.
* Download for $3.99

* File this one under “silly ways to keep yourself entertained on a slow Saturday afternoon.” Dog Generator is exactly what it sounds like—an app that generates dog images. Over 150,000 of them. Now these aren’t super detailed dog images, but more of very basic clipart. But use your creativity and open one of these images in an app like Pixelmator to fill out, OR you could print out the images on actual paper and color them in using crayons!

* If you’re not a fan of video game violence and other animated crimes, you’re probably going to want to stay away from this one. For everyone else, though, meet Armed Heist. It’s an action-packed third person shooter game that lets gamers take part in an epic crime spree. Use the Crime Map to complete over 70 challenges, choose from over 30 unique weapons, and react to dynamic scenarios—no heist plays out the same way twice.

* For more wholesome entertainment, check out Word Trails. This word-building game helps you discover a world of sumptuous semantics, luxurious literacy and phonological freshness. By creating a trail of words, you’ll traverse a world of mysterious islands and explore new modes of letter-hunting in tranquil and natural settings. Early reviews praise the concept but complain of some bugs—most of which appear to have been fixed in 0.4.2.
