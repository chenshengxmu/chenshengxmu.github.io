* Airplane mode disables all of the Apple Watch radios, which is handy when you want to disconnect from all devices, or when you’re flying and are requested to do so by an airline. There are several ways to enable Airplane mode on Apple Watch, as we show you in this continuation of our Apple Watch Guide series.
* To be more specific, there are three ways to manage Airplane mode on Apple Watch:
* Step 1: Open Settings on Apple Watch
* Step 2: Tap the Airplane mode panel
* Step 3: Toggle the Airplane mode switch
* Step 1: From the watch face swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open your glances
* Step 2: Swipe left or right until you locate the Settings glance
* Step 3: Tap the Airplane mode button
* If you have the Mirror iPhone option enabled in the Apple Watch companion app (Apple Watch  → My Watch → Airplane Mode), then enabling Airplane mode on your iPhone will cause it to enable on your Apple Watch and vice versa.

* If Airplane is enabled and you wish to disable it, then the mirroring option will have no effect since there isn’t a Bluetooth signal available to enact the change on the other device. In other words, the Mirror iPhone option only works for enabling Airplane mode, not disabling it.
* Keep in mind that when Airplane mode is enabled, you cannot use any apps installed via the paired iPhone, because they rely on the Bluetooth connection to the iPhone in order to operate.
* Do you have any additional Airplane mode nuggets of wisdom that you wish to share? If so, please leave a comment below.
