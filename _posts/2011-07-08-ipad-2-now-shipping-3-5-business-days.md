* Since the iPad 2’s launch in March, Apple has been facing extreme supply shortages from its manufacturers overseas. The iPad 2 has been flying off the shelves faster than the production line can handle, and part of this problem is due to the recent earthquake disaster in Japan.
* For the past couple months, shipping dates for the iPad 2 on Apple’s online store were set at 1-2 weeks. Despite the iPad 2’s continual high consumer demand, Apple has managed to start shipping the sensational tablet in the normal 3-5 business day timeframe…

* According to MacRumors, the new shipping estimates include engraved and non-engraved models in Apple’s North American, European, and Asia-Pacific distribution channels.
* When the iPad 2 first launched, shipping estimates were set at a staggering 4-5 weeks, and the timeframes have been slowly falling since March.
* The Next Web notes that Apple is expected to sell 40 million iPad 2 units in 2011, with 25 million iPads sold since the product’s original launch 14 months ago. A recent rumor claims that an ‘iPad HD‘ will be unveiled by Apple this Fall with a Retina Display and better performance. All of these reports make it seem very likely that Apple will reach its 40 million units estimate by the end of the year.
* What do you think? Have you ordered an iPad 2 yet?
