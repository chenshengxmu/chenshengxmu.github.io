* A whole bunch of technical drawings of Apple’s spectacular all-glass Campus 2 building got released earlier today by City of Cupertino. We’ve already shown you a 4,300-car underground parking lot plus an insanely massive auditorium designed for theatrical product unveils and exhibitions.
* As the four released PDF documents containing these drawings weigh in at nearly 70 megabytes, we did our homework, extracting high-quality renders for your viewing pleasure.
* Let me tell you, these look absolutely gorgeous on your iPad 3…
* I first extracted the images from PDF files available on the City of Cupertino’s website and saved each in lossless PNG format.
* Next, I used Pixelmator, my go-to image editing program for the Mac, to crop out everything but the renders.
* Then I rescaled the resulting images to the Retina-friendly 2,048-pixel width (the originals were just a few pixels wider) and saved each as a JPG file compressed for 80 percent quality.
* Hope you enjoy these beautiful shots on your brand spanking “new” iPad 3 as much as I do. Just tup on each image to load its Retina-optimized version.
