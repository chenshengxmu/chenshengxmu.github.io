* Apple is going to unveil a new set-top box in June with a redesigned remote control, according to The New York Times. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the publication says the new remote will feature a touchpad for scrolling, at least two physical buttons, and it will be thicker in size than the current aluminum Apple TV remote.
* We’ve heard multiple reports now indicating that Apple is planning to release new TV-related hardware this summer. The device is expected to be introduced at the World Wide Developers Conference with an updated, slimmer design, the faster A8 chip, and an increase in storage to house an upgraded OS and App Store downloads.
* Apple seemingly confirmed the narrative in March, when it dropped the price tag of the current Apple TV from $99 to $69 and added the context ‘starting at,’ suggesting other models are in the pipeline. There has also been fluctuation in inventory of the current Apple TV—which is common for a product line with an impending update.
* In addition to its ‘remote’ scoop, The New York Times corroborates previous reports that Apple is also talking to leading television groups to launch an Internet-based TV service later this year. “The service will offer a bundle of channels that is smaller and cheaper than the broad catalog of offerings in a typical cable subscription.”
* WWDC is slated for June 8 – 12.
