* Wearable devices maker Misfit at CES 2016 announced new products that build on its expertise in health and fitness tracking. A new activity tracker from the company, called the Ray, tracks your movement and sleep and resembles a bracelet with a cylindrical aluminum body.
* Another new product from Misfit, a first for the company: the Specter in-ear wireless headphones with dual driver technology and a built-in accelerometer sensor for tracking your activity and sleep when worn.
* Housed inside an anodized aluminum shell with hidden 8-mm spring bars that allow it to be worn with almost any standard accessory—including watch bands, bracelets or necklaces—the Ray’s three-axis accelerometer captures steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, sleep duration and quality and supports activity tagging.

* The accessory is water-resistant to 50 meters, has a replaceable button cell batteries with six-month life and a multicolor LED display. It also sports piezoelectric vibration that provides incoming call and text alerts, alarms and movement reminders.
* Created in partnership with 1MORE, Misfit’s first-ever headphones feature Bluetooth connectivity, dual driver technology for wide dynamic range and a built-in accelerometer for capturing your movement and sleep data when worn, including steps taken, distance travelled, calories burned and sleep duration and quality.

* Other features of the Specter include noise isolation technology that allows only necessary ambient noise via stereo microphones, hearing protection safeguards hearing health, magnetic ear buds, a built-in line mic and more.
* The Ray is available in Carbon Black and Rose Gold. It can be pre-ordered today from $99 and is set to ship in Spring 2016. The Specter is coming later this year. Both devices are compatible with Misfit’s inexpensive gadget, the Link, and its mobile app.
