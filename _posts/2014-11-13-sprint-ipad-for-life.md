* After unveiling its ‘iPhone for Life’ annual upgrade plan last month, Sprint, the nation’s fourth-largest carrier on Thursday announced a similar ‘iPad for Life’ plan for the latest iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3.
* With this plan, customers can get the latest iPads for $0 down and 24 monthly payments that will vary depending on your chosen storage capacity.
* And like the iPhone for Life plan, the new offering helps customers upgrade to the latest iPad model provided they bring in their existing device in good condition and their lease period has expired.
* Under the terms of the new offering, an entry-level iPad Air 2 with sixteen gigabytes of storage and no cellular access will be available for only $20 per month for 24 months and the iPad mini 3 for $17 per month for 24 months (taxes and fees excluded).

* Both devices are available for a 24-month lease option for qualified customers. After your lease expires, you’ll have the following options:
* And should you activate an iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3 on a new line for any Sprint Family Share Pack 20GB or higher (unlimited talk and text included), the carrier will generously waive the $10 monthly access charge through December 2015. Otherwise, adding an iPad to a Sprint Family Share Pack will incur a $10 per month per line fee.
* The new iPads can also be activated on one of Sprint’s $15/$35/$50/$80/$110 tablet plans with 1GB/3GB/6GB/12GB/30GB of LTE data. As a bonus, Sprint is offering a time-limited plan that gives you a rather meager hundred megabytes of tablet data for ten bucks per month.
* All pricing excludes taxes and surcharges.
* The new iPad for Life plan goes into effect starting Friday, November 14, just like Sprint’s recently announced iPhone for Life 12-month lease.
