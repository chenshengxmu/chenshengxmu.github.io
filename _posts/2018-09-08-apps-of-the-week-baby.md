* This week’s edition of our Apps of the Week roundup features an app for folks driving to talk to other drivers, a powerful digital synthesizer, and an app for video pizza reviews. And as always, we’ve selected two great new games for you to check out.

* Are you a truck driver? Do you have a long daily commute? Going on a road trip? Check out Hey Andy. The app connects you with other drivers that are looking to pass the time via conversation. It works like a Q&A platform, allowing drivers to listen to, reply to and even create their own topics that others can respond to. AI tech connects you to the right conversations and voice commands help you keep your eyes on the road. Interesting!

* Reason Compact puts an amazing-sounding powerful synthesizer right at your fingertips. Go from download to downbeat in just 10 seconds with intuitive controls and helpful tutorials. Other features include presets made by world-class composers, Smart Keyboard for quick creations, and the Europa synthesizer effect. Plus, you can export your track to Reason 10 and take it to the next level. Heads up, some effects are hidden behind IAPs.

* If you’re a Barstool Sports fan at all, chances are you know what One Bite is. It started as a video series offering up brief video reviews of pizza places around the country, and now it’s a standalone application. Even if Barstool isn’t your cup of tea, the app is still pretty compelling with brief, amateur video reviews of pizza joints. It’s perfect for if you’re traveling to a larger city and you want to know the best place to grab a slice.

* Here is a very simple action puzzle game. The only in-game controls are walk and jump, allowing you to enjoy full-scale action with minimal operation. Play through dozens of mysterious levels, collect stars and unlock new slimes and colors. The lower-res graphics may be a turn off for some, but this is one of those games you can pick up and play very quickly.

* And finally, here is another simple game called Golfing Around. It’s a very simple golf simulation. You hit a long drive from the tee, chip onto the green and then put the ball in the hole with a measured putt. Once you get a feel for the controls, you can mix it up by trying to curve your long shot—just be sure to watch out for the wind! Feel like building your own course? You can do that too, and then share it with the community.
