* This week, we’ve gone through a bit of a lull in new jailbreak tweak releases in Cydia. Despite the slowness, there are some releases worth taking a look at.
* We’ll show you our favorite jailbreak tweak releases this week first, and then outline all of the rest of the jailbreak tweaks launched in Cydia. Our favorites are the ones we thought were either the most fun to use, or made the biggest impact on how we use our devices.
* Gravitation – $1.99

* A blast from the past, Gravitation is a modern-day replacement for the classic Graviboard jailbreak tweak from 2010 that brought a physics-based gravitational force to your Home screen.
* With this tweak installed, you can activate the gravity whenever you want to, and your app icons will all fall in the direction of gravity using your device’s accelerator to do so.
* To learn more about Gravitation and even to see a demonstration of how it’s used, you can read our full review.
* Snakebite – $0.99

* Definitely worth the mention this week was the release of Snakebite, a highly-anticipated release that uses 3D Touch on supported devices, or a special touch screen gesture on others to reveal a new App Switcher-like interface for viewing your favorite or recently-used apps.
* The beauty of the tweak’s user interface and fluid functionality are what draw me in the most. It’s a tweak that you can actually get excited about and will likely use over and over again.
