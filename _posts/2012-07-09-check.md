* Check is a new jailbreak tweak that allows you to select a range of emails on the iPhone or iPad’s stock mail app in a more efficient manner. Instead of selecting each email one-by-one, Check utilizes a new tap and hold shortcut to make it simpler to select a range of emails.

* The best jailbreak tweaks are those that solve common problems in a simple and straightforward manner, and Check excels at this. In fact, there are no options to configure upon installation, and it’s ready to use immediately.
* The fact that it’s a free download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo is just icing on the cake. The only reason you wouldn’t want to try Check is if you’re not a user of iOS’ stock mail app.
