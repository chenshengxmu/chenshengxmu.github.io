* The latest set-top box out of Cupertino is set to land in customers’ households tomorrow, however, a few reviews of the new Apple TV are coming our way this evening. Publications have gotten the chance to review the new Apple TV, which features 1080p capabilities powered by a single-core A5 processor, and also features an updated UI.
* Here’s what people are saying:
* The Verge:
* This year’s Apple TV is a strange little device. Nearly everything it did before, it now does better — it streams 1080p content, is easier than ever to navigate, and remains one of the simplest devices to set up and use that we’ve seen. But when I reviewed the 2010 Apple TV, my biggest concerns were all about the content: the available content on a device like the Boxee Box or the Roku positively dwarfed the Apple TV. That’s still true, though the iTunes integration with Netflix is a solid sign that Apple’s thinking the right way.
* The Loop:
* The interface is very easy to navigate and use. Like an iOS device, you just navigate to the section you want and select it — it opens and you’re ready to go.
* I also like the fact that, for Netflix’s at least, when you launch the section you can setup a new account and have it charged directly to your Apple ID. That’s very convenient. All of my bills and charges in one place.
* At $99 the Apple TV is a no-brainer for any home entertainment system.
* Macworld:
* At $99, the third-generation Apple TV continues to be as excellent a value as the previous model—and now it supports higher-quality video too. That’s a good thing. For those with the previous generation, however, the decision to upgrade comes down to whether the difference in quality between two high-definition formats is important (and noticeable) enough to you.
* Stick to iDB all Friday, where we’ll be bringing you full coverage of the third-generation iPad and Apple TV launch. Stay tuned!
