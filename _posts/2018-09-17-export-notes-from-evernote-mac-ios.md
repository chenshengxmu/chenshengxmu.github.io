* Evernote is a robust note-taking application with availability across multiple platforms, but it does have its limitations. For instance, the Evernote Basic plan only allows you to use the app on two devices for free.  So, maybe you’ve decided to use another app in addition to Evernote. Or, maybe the time comes when you want to switch to a different note-taking app completely.
* You can easily export notes from Evernote to a file that can then be imported to another note-taking application and here’s how.
* If you would like to export a single note from Evernote on Mac, follow these steps:
* 1) Open the Evernote app on your Mac.
* 2) Select the note you want to export.
* 3) Either right-click on the note or hold your Control key and click to open the context menu.
* 4) Choose Export Note.

* 5) In the pop-up window, select the location to save the export file, give it a name, and optionally mark the box to include tags you have attached to your note. You can also adjust the file type from .enex, which is the Evernote file format, to HTML.
* 6) Click Save.

* Follow the same steps as above to choose the location, add a name, and save the notes.
* Now that you have exported your Evernote note or group of notes, you can import that file into other note-taking applications. Just be sure that the app you use allows an import with the Evernote file format which ends in .enex or HTML, if that’s the format you chose when saving the file.
* Some example apps that you can import notes into with the Evernote file format include OneNote, Bear, and most conveniently, your Mac Notes app.
* The process for importing the file will vary depending on the application that you use. So, check the app’s help section if you need assistance.
* Exporting notes from Evernote is very simple and you can also use that file as a way to back up a single note or group of notes from a notebook. Are there any other tutorials or tips you’d like to see us cover for Evernote? Let us know in the comments below!
