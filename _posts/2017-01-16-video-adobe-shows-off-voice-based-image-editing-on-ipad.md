* How about editing photographs by voice commands alone? In a recent concept video, Adobe showed off performing basic image-editing functions on an iPad by conversing with a Siri-like digital assistant. The proof-of-concept clip gives us an interesting glimpse into a not-so-distant future when we’ll use our voice for complex tasks beyond simple things like scheduling reminders or creating alarms.
* The project was born out of Adobe’s Research team, which set out to explore what an intelligent digital assistant photo editing might look like. “With Adobe Sensei we combined the emerging science of voice interaction with a deep understanding of both creative workflows and the creative aspirations of our customers,” said the firm.
* Adobe’s in-house speech recognition system is able to directly accept natural user voice instructions for image editing. It works either locally, through on-device computing, or through a cloud-based natural language understanding service.
* Does image editing via a dedicated personal assistant make sense to you?
