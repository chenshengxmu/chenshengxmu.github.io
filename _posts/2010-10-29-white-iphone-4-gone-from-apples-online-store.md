* We heard this might happen, but seeing is believing. Apple has totally removed any trace of the white iPhone 4 from the online store. No more “coming soon,” it’s just gone.
* There are now just three flavors of iPhone’s advertised on the Apple store, the Black 8GB 3GS, the Black 16GB iPhone 4, and the 32GB Black iPhone 4. Of course, this will inevitably change with the next iteration of the device — the iPhone 5. Hmm, Verizon anyone?
