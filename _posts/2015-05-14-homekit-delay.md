* Apple was forced to delay its planned launch of HomeKit, a Siri-assisted platform for the connected home, as its software teams continue working around the clock to shrink down the code base to run efficiently on small devices, according to a report Thursday by Fortune.
* Fortune writer Stacey Higginbotham claims that Apple’s connected home platform will likely arrive in fall — late August-ish or early September-ish — rather than in early summer as originally planned.
* Although Apple never committed to a specific timeframe for HomeKit’s launch, the report cited sources participating in the program as saying that “Apple is planning a smaller announcement around HomeKit in the near term, but not the official launch.”
* According to the report, optimizing the HomeKit code for efficient execution on door locks, light bulbs and other smart home devices has proved more difficult than Apple originally anticipated.
* One source said the code base associated with that part of the process “blew up” and required way too much memory for battery-powered devices, “so Apple is trying to shrink the code back down to size.”
* Announced almost a year ago at Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference last summer, the HomeKit platform is basically a framework in iOS 8 for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user’s home, using actions that can be chained together and controlled through Siri.
* Code strings discovered in the Apple TV software indicate that the set-top console will act as a HomeKit hub for remote Siri features.

* HomeKit-compatible hardware will require Apple’s ‘Made for iPhone’ (MFi) certification to ensure compatible devices are up to its security and ease of use standards.
* As a result, third-parties are required to apply for the MFi certification and use certified hardware in their products.
* Earlier this week, chip maker and Apple supplier Broadcom released a software development kit that lets others use its new Bluetooth Smart chip and software tools to power HomeKit-compliant home automation devices controllable via a HomeKit-supported app and Siri on iOS devices.
