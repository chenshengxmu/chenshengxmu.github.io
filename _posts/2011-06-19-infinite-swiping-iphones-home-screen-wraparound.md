title: Bring Infinite Swiping to Your iPhones Home Screen with Wraparound

* It’s time to add another entry to the, “why didn’t Apple think about that?” list.
* Introducing: Wraparound — a jailbreak tweak for the iPhone that allows you to scroll indefinitely on your Home screen.
* Normally when you reach your last page of apps, you’re restricted from going any further. With Wraparound installed, this restriction is a thing of the past.
* Instead of reaching a dead end on your iPhone’s Home screen, you’ll be rerouted back to the Spotlight page for another go ’round, and you can do so until your fingers get tired of swiping…
* It’s an extremely simple tweak, with no settings or app icons to speak of, but it does something that’s indispensable in my mind.
* True, you could always tap the Home button to get back to your springboard’s first page, but there’s nothing like maintaining your forward (or backward) momentem when navigating your iPhone.
* That’s why I think that despite the somewhat steep asking price of $1.99 on Cydia, many of you who have jailbroken iPhones will consider Wraparound a must-have.
* What do you think? Are you digging the ability to have infinite swiping ability on your device, or are you good with how things currently are?
