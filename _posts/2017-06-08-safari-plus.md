* Safari is the stock web browser on the iOS platform, and love it or hate it, the jailbreak community has come up with countless ways to customize it for the better.
* One of the latest releases to benefit the Safari web browser is a jailbreak tweak dubbed Safari Plus by iOS developer opa334. This tweak brings a host of new configuration options so you can customize Safari any way you see fit.
* Safari Plus covers a wide band of features, ranging from aesthetic to functional. It adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can access all of the options in one place:

* In the Action Addons section, you’ll find all of the following options:

* Other Addons
* In the Other Addons section, you’ll find a couple of miscellaneous options, including:
* Color Settings
* In the Color Settings section, you can colorize the Safari app by configuring custom colors for both normal and private browsing mode. Among those, you can configure colors for the following UI elements:
* For each colorization option, you are presented with a color picker, which means you can pick from an infinite pool of colors instead of a list of predefined colors. This is great because it lets you get in between certain colors and get the exact color you’re looking for.
* Overall, Safari Plus is a high-quality tweak worth grabbing. It has a lot to offer in a free package, and I was surprised to see this wasn’t a paid tweak when I first laid eyes on it.
* Safari Plus can be had from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and the developer has also open-sourced the tweak on GitHub for those interested in learning more about how it works behind the scenes. Worthy of note, the tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
