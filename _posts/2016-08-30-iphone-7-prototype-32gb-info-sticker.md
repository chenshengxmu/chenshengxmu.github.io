* Various leaks published over the past few months by solid sources have strongly indicated that the iPhone 7 would at long last ditch its oft-criticized 16-gigabyte tier, replacing it with a 32-gigabyte SKU as the new entry-level option for buyers. Based on the image of an info sticker of an alleged iPhone 7 prototype obtained from Foxconn, that smartphone leakster The Malignant tweeted out this morning, it would seem that the next iPhone might indeed start out at 32GB.
* The “D10” label tells us the sticker is most likely for an iPhone 7 prototype, based on the previously reported D10 iPhone 7 code-name. The Wall Street Journal and other outlets previously corroborated that upcoming iPhones would come outfitted with a minimum of 32 gigabytes of storage on base models.

* The sticker identifies the prototype as “1902 of 3000,” with a return date of August 29.
* The Malignant commented that Apple had at least three iPhone 7 prototypes—D10, D11 and D12—one of which could be the elusive iPhone 7 Pro that may have been ditched.
* According to supply chain sources and Apple analysts, the iPhone 7 will also come in a 256-gigabyte flavor, or double the storage of the current 128GB iPhones.
* In another tweet, The Malignant said iPhone 7 would have full native support for GIFs.
* #iPhone7 finally full GIF native support!

* As for the pictured sticker, you shouldn’t take it as a sign that the iPhone 7 will indeed start out at 32 gigabytes of storage because Apple is known for prototyping multiple versions of devices, some of which never see the light of day.
* The company is set to announce new iPhones on September 7.
