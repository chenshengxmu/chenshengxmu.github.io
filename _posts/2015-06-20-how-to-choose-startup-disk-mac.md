* If you have multiple bootable partitions on your Mac, such as the case when you create a separate partition for testing a new OS, you’ll need to know how to manage your Mac’s startup disk.
* The startup disk is the disk that the Mac boots from when restarting your computer. You can change this disk permanently, or change it on a temporary case-by-case basis.
* In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to establish a set startup disk, and how to change the startup disk on the fly as you reboot your Mac.
* Step 1: Open System Preferences.
* Step 2: Click Startup Disk.
* Step 3: Click the disk that you wish to use as your Mac’s permanent startup disk.
* Whenever you reboot your computer, your Mac will always boot to the selected disk. You can change this setting at your leisure.
* Step 1: Reboot your Mac while holding the Option (⌥) key on your keyboard to load the Startup Manager.
* Step 2: From Startup Manager, click on the disk that you wish to boot from.
* That’s all there is to it. I recommend using the Startup Disk option in system preferences if you plan on using a particular disk for an extended period of time, otherwise, it may be best just to temporarily switch disks using the Startup Manager on reboot.
* Which option do you use when managing your startup disks?
