* Apple just announced via its Investor Relations portal that it will be announcing the financial results for its first fiscal quarter of 2015 on Tuesday, January 27. As usual, the company will be hosting a conference call to discuss its earnings, beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.
* This will be Apple’s most significant earnings report in some time, as it covers the three month holiday shopping period, and follows the launch of a major iPhone refresh. Analysts are anxious to see if the Cupertino firm still has what it takes to break sales records in December.
* By most accounts, it does. Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for iPhone sales in Q1 to 67 million units—much higher than the Wall Street consensus of 63 million units—and analysts in general are expecting Apple’s revenue to near the $70 million mark for the 3-month period.
* We’ll of course be posting Apple’s earnings, along with other important announcements on the 27th, so be sure to tune in.
