* Following up on its August update which brought out uploading functionality in addition to some interesting private sharing options, Vimeo on Thursday issued a brand new version of its iPhone and iPad client.
* Now at version 5.1.1, Vimeo’s video pages have gained more informative layouts with the title, creator, play count and other information.
* Active Vimeo users often complained about an avalanche of notifications from the site. Feeling their pain, the video sharing site has finally made it possible to cherry-pick notifications to receive in the Vimeo app.
* Jump past the fold for other Vimeo 5.1.1 highlights.
* Vimeo makes it easy to mark videos for later viewing, even when without an Internet connection. The video site is home to some of the best user-generated clips and premium videos on the web so I’ve been kinda using this feature on a regular basis.
* But due to the clunky interface, finding offline videos used to be a tedious affair. Luckily, the team saw to that so Vimeo 5.1.1 now makes it easy to find the clips marked for offline viewing in your Downloads stream.
* Vimeo 5.1.1. changelog:
* The 33.9-megabyte universal app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Grab Vimeo for the iPhone and iPad free in the App Store.
* Pictured top of post: Vimeo’s recently revamped Apple TV channel sporting a redesigned interface, an all-new on-demand trailers, staff favorites and other perks.
