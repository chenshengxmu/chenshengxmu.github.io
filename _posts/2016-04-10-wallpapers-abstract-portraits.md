* Every Sunday, iDownloadBlog brings you a fresh set of iOS device wallpapers for the Wallpapers of the Week section. One of the quickest and easiest, non-jailbreak, ways to change the look and mood of your device, is to keep an ever changing library of fresh images ready for the moment.
* The section contains images from a myriad of places around the web, including user submissions and original pieces. Today’s images focus on abstract portraits, modern images that are not solely focused on the subject, but the environment they portray. 
* The featured images in this week’s post were shared via Twitter. The following wallpapers were gathered from @_macinmac_’s personal imgur gallery, where a massive collection of images are stored.
* If you would like to send us a tip, image, or link, catch up with me via Twitter @jim_gresham. No tip–no problem, just hang around for the RT’s and more images I find that don’t make it to the post.
