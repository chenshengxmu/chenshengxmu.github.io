* Read receipts are some of the most pesky things known to mankind. They’re there to let you know when someone reads your messages, or when you read someone else’s message, but some people are too reliant on the feature and hawk-eye your read receipt status only to questionnaire you later on about why it took you so long to reply.
* Delay Read Receipts (iOS 10) is a tweak that lets you choose when your read receipts are actually sent to your recipient. It lets you read their message to you in peace and then delays your read receipt until you either start typing back or send a message.
* The idea is that it withholds your read receipt until you’re ready, and whether you’re dealing with an antsy boss or a flustered significant other, this tweak offers a lot of potential to help you out.
* You can read our full review of Delay Read Receipts (iOS 10) to learn more about how it works and when to use it.
* QuickPowerMode – FREE

* Turning on Low Power Mode on an iPhone is a convoluted process because you have to launch the Settings app and go into the Battery preferences pane just to find the toggle switch.
* While some tweaks have aimed to make toggling Low Power Mode easier, they still require more actions than you might want to take. QuickPowerMode is the answer, because with it, you can simply tap on the battery icon in your Status Bar to toggle Low Power Mode on or off on demand.

* Safe Alarm 3 (iOS 10) – $1.99
