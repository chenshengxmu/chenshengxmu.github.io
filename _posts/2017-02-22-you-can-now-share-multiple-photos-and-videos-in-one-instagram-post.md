* Photo-sharing service Instagram announced today that users are now able to share up to ten photos and videos in a single post and swipe through to see them all. Such multi-item posts are presented inline in your feed in a carousel format that displays only the first item of the post.
* The first photo or video shows a new icon, denoting there’s more to see. Simply swipe to reveal additional media.
* You can adjust the order in which your photos and videos appear, edit them one by one or apply a filter to everything at once. Instagram 10.9 for iOS is required for this functionality.
* “With this update, you no longer have to choose the single best photo or video from an experience you want to remember,” said Instagram. To create a carousel-style post, tap a new icon when uploading media to your feed to select multiple items.
* Carousel-style posts can be liked and commented on just like regular ones. Comments and likes appear on the entire post, rather than on its individual items.
* You’re not able to reorder, edit or delete parts of the posts you’ve shared nor can you change the accounts you’ve tagged in your post.
* Watch Instagram’s promotional video showing the new feature in action.
* To change the order in which your photos and videos appear, simply tap and hold an item and drag it to a desired spot. To remove an item from the post, hold and drag it to the trashcan icon at the top of the screen. To adjust how each photo or video is cropped, tap it then touch the screen to adjust how it fits in the frame.
* “These posts have a single caption and are square-only for now,” notes the Facebook-owned mobile photography service. Blue dots at the bottom of these posts in your feed let you know you can swipe to see more.
* You can also add a location and caption for the entire post, even after it’s shared, or tag someone in each individual photo: tap Tag People, then swipe to find the photo you’d like to tag someone in. You can delete the post at any time, but you cannot reorder, edit or delete parts of the posts you’ve shared.

* To learn more about sharing up to ten photos and videos simultaneously in a single post, be sure to read newly added articles in Instagram’s Help Center. Again, this feature requires Instagram 10.9 for iOS, which is currently rolling out on App Store.
* Grab Instagram for free from App Store.
