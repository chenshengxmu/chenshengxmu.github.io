* I knew they were up to somethingâ€¦ Some great news coming from the head of the Dev Team, MuscleNerd announced that they are working on releasing an update to the famous RedSn0w, the fast jailbreak method for Windows users.
* RedSn0w might be the solution for frustrated BlackRa1n users who are having troubles with their jailbreak. While RedSn0w 0.9 might not be as fast as BlackRa1n, itâ€™s most likely going to be much more reliable.
* As soon as RedSn0w is available, I will write a tutorial on how to jailbreak your iPhone with it, so stay tuned ðŸ™‚
