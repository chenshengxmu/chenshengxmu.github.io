* Apple has pulled QuickPick from the App Store after the application was discovered over the weekend as a means of displaying system shortcuts in the iOS 5 Notification Center. We showed you QuickPick in action on video, and the $0.99 app was available for both the iPhone and iPad.
* It’s unclear as to why Apple pulled QuickPick from the App Store, but the app did use iOS URL schemes to invoke system shortcuts — a feature that Apple has already tried to block in iOS. If you try to download QuickPick from the App Store right now, you’ll be told that the app is now unavailable.
