* Yesterday, Apple posted a slew of beta updates including iOS 11.2, tvOS 11.2, and watchOS 4.2.
* To see all the changes in watchOS 4.2 beta 1 for yourself, check out our video.

* watchOS 4.2 seems like a relatively minor update so far with a few small yet noticeable tweaks, but Apple could easily implement more new features and enhancements in subsequent betas.
* The only real major change so far is a new shortcut button when playing audio, plus some tweaked emoji looks and the usual batch of under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes.
* When you go to play audio, like from the new Radio or Music app, it will present you with options for audio. I have my AirPods so whenever I go to play audio, it previously would just show AirPods as my option.
* Now, it shows me AirPods along with a new Add New shortcut leading to the Bluetooth section in Settings where I can quickly pair a new Bluetooth audio device.
* Another minor tweak is some changes to emoji.
* While the new watchOS 4.1 software brought 70+ new emoji, watchOS 4.2 tweaks some of them, like the camera emoji which looks much more realistic than the flat one in the past.
* Apple pushed the watchOS 4.2 beta yesterday before briefly pulling it offline for some undisclosed reason. It came back later in the evening, and I’ve been testing it since.
* I’ve had nearly a day to test out, and it seems the battery life is really good. I wore my watch through the night to track my sleep, and about half of the day so far. After all that, I currently am at 78 percent of my battery.
* That is surprisingly good, especially for an initial beta.
* How are you liking watchOS 4.2 so far?
