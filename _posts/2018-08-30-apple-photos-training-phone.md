* Wanna take Photos for iOS and macOS to the next level? If so, consider signing up for Apple’s new one-on-one training lessons that are available to customers in the United States?
* “Our specially trained Apple Support Advisors are experts in using Photos to transform pictures from good to amazing—and they’d love to show you how in a 30-minute guided phone session,” reads Apple’s support document published earlier this week.
* Aside from photo management and sharing features, the Photos apps have built-in editing tools for one-tap fixes, including curve-based editing that makes it possible to fine-tune all the details in the palm of your hand.
* “The session is all about you, so bring your favorite photos and your questions,” Apple clarifies. “Your session guide will make sure to emphasize the tools that you’re most interested in, and show you the best way to enhance each picture.”
* The session covers the following features:
* “You’ll have 30 minutes one-on-one with a Photos expert who’ll describe how to edit pictures from your own collection,” the company explains. “They’ll tailor the session to your skill level and show you how to get the results you want.”
* This is awesome.
* If you’re still kinda finding your way around Photos and was wondering how to make the most of the app, do yourself a favor and schedule your phone session now to learn something new.
* TUTORIAL: Teaching Photos to recognize people’s faces
* Apple recommends updating your devices to the latest edition of the operating system and using speakerphone or headphones during your session so your hands are free while you talk to your advisor.
* As mentioned, those Photos courses are not available outside of the US.
