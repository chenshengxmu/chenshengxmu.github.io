* As we reported, Apple and Australian hearing aids maker Cochlear struck a partnership in July. Today, Cochlear released its first product born out of that partnership—a tiny “Made for iOS”-certified hearing implant that can stream audio wirelessly from an iOS device directly to a surgically embedded Nucleus 7 sound processor.
* Available starting today in Australia, Cochlear says the device will hit other markets soon.
* Hearing-impaired customers can take advantage of the accessory to listen to music and podcasts in high-quality stereo sound, make calls, watch videos and more, with the sound streamed wirelessly directly to the implant. The company’s Nucleus 7 sound chip files as the world’s first “Made for iOS”-certified cochlear implant sound processor.
* The implant is compatible with any iPhone from iPhone 5 onward, all iPad Pro models, iPad mini and later and the fourth-generation iPad and later.
* Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s Director of Accessibility technologies, told The Australian that Apple has partnered with other hearing aid makers on similar solutions.
* We consider it one of our core corporate values, an area where we put significant amount of time and energy ensuring our products work for everyone.
* We started looking at this program around the concept of Bluetooth LE and how it would be a beneficial tool in this specific circumstance. The work we have done is applicable both to hearing aids and sound processors.
* In working with Cochlear on this integration, Apple in 2014 developed a more advanced form of Bluetooth low-energy audio, called Low Energy Audio, that lets tiny hearing implants connect to iOS without draining the battery.
