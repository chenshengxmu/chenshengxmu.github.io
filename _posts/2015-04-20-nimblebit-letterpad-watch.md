* Long-time developer NimbleBit, responsible for several hit titles such as Tiny Tower and Pocket Planes, released a new game on Monday called ‘Letterpad.’ It’s a word puzzler, and it’s available for free for both the iPhone and iPad, as well as the Apple Watch.
* The game tasks players with finding words related to the given topic, hidden within a group of 9 letters. So if the topic is ‘Music,’ you’ll want to uncover words related to that such as radio or jam. Find all the words, and work your way through over 200 puzzles.
* There are a few things that make Letterpad different from other word game offerings. For one, you can create and share your own puzzles, and NimbleBit even says it will add community-created content regularly. And two, the game will support Apple Watch play.
* The only real hint of IAPs or advertising I could find was in the game’s ‘Reveal a letter’ hint feature, otherwise it’s distraction-free. It’s worth noting, however, that the title does require you to be running iOS 8 or later. You can find Letterpad for free in the App Store here.
