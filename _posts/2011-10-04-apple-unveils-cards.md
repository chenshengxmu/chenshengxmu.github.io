* Well, that was bizarre. The first “major” anouncement at Apple’s media event this afternoon was Cards; as in greeting cards.
* Yes, Cards is an upcoming app from Apple themselves, which will allow end users to create greeting cards right on their iPhones.
* Apple will then print it out, address it, mail it, and send you a push notification when it arrives…

* Cards is set to go live on October 12th. You will be able to create cards right on your iPhone for $2.99 per card; that includes shipping, the envelope, the whole shebang.
* Cards includes 21 different template designs, so there will be sure to be something for everyone.

* I can’t say that anyone saw this coming, but I could see this feature being a popular one amongst artsy, and older iOS users. What about you?
