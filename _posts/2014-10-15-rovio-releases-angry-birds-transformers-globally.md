* Following its soft-launch in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Finland on September 25, Rovio’s Angry Birds Transformers is now available globally as a free-to-play download for the iPhone and iPad, the Finnish mobile games maker announced Wednesday morning.
* Featuring cars, trucks, tanks and planes and a plethora of heroes and villains with unique attacks and abilities, the movie tie-in challenges your Autobirds (I chuckled) to save Piggy Island from the crazed robots on a mission to nuke it out of orbit.
* The familiar Angry Birds characters have been given an amusing Transformers-themed makeover so Red becomes Optimus Prime, Chuck is Bumblebee and so forth.
* “They’ve got lasers and they turn into cars,” says the blurb. ”Plus they have arms and legs – that’s a first!” Surprisingly, Autobirds have to join forces with their arch rivals — wait for this — the Deceptihogs, which Rovio says are like the Decepticons from the movies, “only smellier”.
