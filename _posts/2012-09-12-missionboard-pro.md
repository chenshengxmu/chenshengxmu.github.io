* MissionBoard Pro — like the original MissionBoard — is a jailbreak tweak that acts as an app switcher replacement for the iPhone.
* In contrast with the basic version of MissionBoard, the pro version features elements like music controls and toggles to make it much more suitable as an outright app switcher replacement. But is it worth its steep $2.99 asking price?
* The new control panel features found in MissionBoard pro make the upgrade worthy of consideration, but be warned that the tweak was still a bit sluggish in response, just like the original version that I reviewed.
* If you’re serious about using MissionBoard as an app switcher replacement, then the pro version is a necessity due to the music controls, toggles, brightness slider, etc. However, if you don’t care so much about these things, then stick with the free version.
* MissionBoard Pro can be purchased for $2.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, so it’s not exactly cheap. What are your thoughts on the tweak?
