* I guess I was right… once again. In a move aimed at pleasing every iPhone 4 customer, Apple just announced they are giving away cases to every iPhone 4 owner.
* Apple doesn’t make enough Bumpers to satisfy the demand so instead of giving us Bumpers, they will give us the option to choose from several cases (including the Bumper). If you bought a Bumper before, guess what, you will get a refund!
* You’ll be able to apply on Apple’s website to order your free case starting at the end of next week.
