* Wrapping up our extensive coverage of yesterday’s Tim Cook appearance at the D10: All Things Digital conference, we just learned that event organizer, News Corp.-owned the Wall Street Journal, has reached an agreement with Apple to make all six Steve Jobs chats at D events available free on iTunes.
* This is good news for anyone with the slightest interest in Steve Jobs and his public speaking, even more so knowing only Jobs’ D5 and D8 interviews have been available on iTunes so far…
* According to technology columnists and conference hosts Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, this material is now available on iTunes for the first time as their way of paying tribute to the tech titan who could hold audiences worldwide in the palm of his hand.
* The clips cover the period from 2003 to 2010, including the now famous simultaneous appearance of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates at the D5 conference, as well as Jobs’ final D8 interview in 2010, right following the launch of the original iPad, when the legendary Apple co-founder vividly laid out his vision of the post-PC world, including the memorable “PCs are gonna be like trucks” analogy.
* According to AllThingsD:
* So, as a memorial to a great man and in the spirit of sharing a priceless piece of history, we are making all six of these appearances available free, in high-quality video. We thank Apple for its cooperation in making these videos available for all.
* From the official iTunes description:
* There’s lots of video of the late Steve Jobs, primarily from his famous introductions of Apple products over the years, and his oft-quoted Stanford commencement address. But, by far, the largest trove of video of the legendary innovator candidly answering unrehearsed questions and explaining his views on technology and business comes from his six lengthy appearances at our D: All Things Digital Conference, from 2003 to 2010.
* The podcast includes six episodes of Jobs’ D conference appearances, plus a little surprise titled Steve Jobs’ Legacy – Reflections from AllThingsD.
* Per iTunes description of this episode:
* We’ve added to the podcast a packagge of articles published on AllThingsD.com that reflect on the life and legacy of Steve Jobs. Included are two pieces from Walt Mossberg – one published when Jobs stepped down as CEO of Apple and the other upon his passing. We’ve als oadded posts from Ira Fried, who wrote about Bill Gates’ sentiment on the passing of Jobs, and about The Three Irreplaceable Qualities of Steve Jobs.
* What are you waiting for, download video or audio podcasts on iTunes now.
* Note: give it a little while as the changes propagate across iTunes servers the world over.
