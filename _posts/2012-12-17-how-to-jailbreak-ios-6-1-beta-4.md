* Apple seeded the 4th beta installment of iOS 6.1 just a while ago, and it’s now available as both a delta update, and a direct download via Apple’s developer portal.
* As we always strive to do, we’ve taken it upon ourselves to jailbreak iOS 6.1 beta 4 as a confirmation that it can be done. Inside, we’ll show you the exact steps that you need to take in order to do the same on your qualifying iOS 6 beta 4 device.
* A few notes of warning before we get started, shall we?
* Per the norm, this jailbreak is for pre-A5 devices (e.g. iPhone 4, iPod touch 4th generation, and iPhone 3GS). This jailbreak is a tethered jailbreak only, and relies on the publicly available iOS 6.0 firmware for your respective device. This is for developers only. If you do not meet all of the aforementioned criteria, then it is best to wait until iOS 6.1 is fully public.
* Okay, simply follow the instructions below to jailbreak your device.
* Step 1: Download iOS 6.1 beta 4 for your qualifying device via Apple’s developer portal, or as a delta update.
* Step 2: Download iOS 6.0 for your qualifying device via our downloads page.
* Step 3: Download the latest version of RedSn0w (0.9.15b3) from our downloads page.
* Step 4: Connect your device to your computer, and open RedSn0w. Place your device into DFU mode, and RedSn0w should pick up the device in DFU mode.
* Step 5: Click Extras > Select IPSW > and select the iOS 6.0 IPSW we told you to download in Step 2. RedSn0w 0.9.15b3 should successfully identify the firmware.
* Step 6: Go back to the main page of RedSn0w and click Jailbreak. Once it finishes processing, make sure Install Cydia is checked, and click Next to finish the entire jailbreak process.
* Step 7: Eventually, after a somewhat lengthy process, the iPhone will appear back on the Lock screen. Place the device back into DFU mode.
* Step 8: Again, from the main page of RedSn0w, click Extras > Select IPSW > and select the iOS 6.0 firmware. RedSn0w should successfully identify the firmware.
* Step 9: Click Boot tethered, and a tethered boot will be performed on your device. This, like the initial jailbreak, is a somewhat lengthy process. You should see a pineapple logo during bootup, signifying a successful tethered boot.
* Step 10: Once the tethered boot is complete, you should be back at your device’s Lock screen. unlock the device, and swipe over to the second page. It may take a few seconds, but eventually you should see the Cydia icon appear. Open Cydia and let it perform its initial configuration and setup.
* Congratulations, you just successfully jailbroke iOS 6.1 beta 4 for your device. Keep in mind that this is a tethered boot, so you will need to perform steps 8 and 9 again in order to restart your device at any time.
* Another friendly reminder that we’d like to reiterate. This firmware is for developers only, and hence this jailbreak is for Cydia developers looking to test out the compatibility of their apps and tweak for Cydia. If you’re not a registered Apple developer, it’s highly advised that you wait a bit until 6.1 officially drops. We presume that you won’t have to wait much longer.
