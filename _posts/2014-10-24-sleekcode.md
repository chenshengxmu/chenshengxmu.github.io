* SleekCode is a brand new jailbreak tweak that just recently touched down on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. SleekCode allows you to change up the look of the passcode screen. You can alter the background of the blur, alpha, and passcode rings, along with hiding the emergency dial button and slide to unlock chevron.
* I was fairly impressed with the look of the passcode screen after configuring SleekCode. Have a look at our video walkthrough for more information.
* Once you install SleekCode, you’ll find a new preference panel in the stock Settings app. Inside the preferences, you’ll see 5 different switches assigned to specific settings along with a Respring button. Each switch can work independently of one another, and corresponds to the blur, alpha, and button ring mentioned at the outset.
* Each change that you make to SleekCode’s switches requires a respring before the changes take place. Thankfully, that is easily accomplished due to the Respring button at the bottom of the tweak’s settings.
* As you can see from the video, SleekCode lives up to its name fairly well, and results in a sleeker looking minimalist passcode view. I highly recommend turning off the button ring switch, and keeping every other switch enabled. To me, that’s the best look that you can achieve with SleekCode.
* SleekCode works fine on devices running iOS 7 and higher. And yes, that includes the newly jailbroken iOS 8. You can find it free of charge on the BigBoss repo. Share your thoughts in the comment section down below.
