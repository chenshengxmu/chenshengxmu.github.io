* The Mac’s Finder isn’t as versatile a file manager when it comes to copying a file or folder’s full path as the Windows Explorer app is.
* To be sure, macOS has long allowed you to enable an interactive file path at the bottom of Finder windows, and even show the complete path in a window’s titlebar, but these methods won’t let you copy an item’s full path to the system clipboard easily.
* Starting with OS X 10.11 El Capitan, Apple has introduced a new Copy Pathname option that makes it very easy to do just that. And in this tutorial, we’re going to show you how to copy a file or folder’s complete path on Mac, directly from the Finder.
* Step 1: Launch a new Finder window by choosing New Finder Window under the Finder’s File menu.

* Step 2: Navigate to a desired file or folder and click the item in the Finder window while holding the Control (⌃) key, which will bring up a contextual menu populated with various file-related operations.
* Step 3: Now hold down the Option (⌥) key to reveal a hidden option in the contextual menu, labeled “Copy (file/folder name) as Pathname”.

* Step 4: Selecting this option will copy the complete, not relative, pathname of your item into the system clipboard.
* Now you can easily paste the item’s complete path in other apps using macOS’ system-wide Command (⌘) – V shortcut.
* Again, the Copy Pathname feature is only available in OS X 10.11 El Capitan or later and cannot be found in earlier OS X editions.
