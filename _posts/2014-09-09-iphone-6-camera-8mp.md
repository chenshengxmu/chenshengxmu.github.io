* As expected, Apple has elected to stay with 8 megapixels for the iPhone 6’s rear camera, but it is made a number of other improvements. The camera comes in at 1.5µ pixels, with a ƒ/2.2 aperture, true tone flash, and an all-new image sensor, which Apple says has ‘focus pixels.’ Apparently these pixels do “phase detection” autofocus, which amounts to autofocus that’s twice as fast as the 5s’ camera.
* Apple says that with the new technology it’s added to its iSight camera, face detection is faster, and blink / smile detection is much improved. Also Panoramas can be up to 43 megapixels now. This is where things get a little dicey, the iPhone 6 has digital image stabilization, but the 6 Plus has optical image stabilization. The latter moves the lens around to adjust for shakiness and things like that.
* As for video capabilities, the cameras can record video at 1080p at 30 or 60fps, or slow-motion at 240fps. Both iPhone models will feature “cinematic video stabilization,” which also attempts to eliminate shakiness during filming. To wrap it up, Apple says the front facing (or FaceTime) camera has also been upgraded for taking “those killer selfies.” It also mentions “burst selfies,” but doesn’t elaborate.
