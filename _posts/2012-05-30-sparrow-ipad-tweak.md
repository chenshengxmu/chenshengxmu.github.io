* Push Notifications are one thing, but support for the iPad is a whole ‘nother area where Sparrow is lacking for iOS. As of now, the popular 3rd party email client is iPhone-only, making it difficult for users who have both devices to fully commit to using it.
* But as usual, a jailbreak developer is making serious headway on bringing native-like iPad support to Sparrow via a handy tweak. SparrowPlus may already be familiar to a lot of you, it’s the same tweak that allows you to make Sparrow your iPhone’s default mail client, along with Push Notifications.
* Now the developer behind SparrowPlus is working on an update to bring improved Sparrow support to the iPad. It’s not perfect, but as you’ll see from our hands-on video, it certainly shows some promise…
* SparrowPlus is a huge improvement over simply running the Sparrow app in 2X mode on the iPad. The UI elements have been scaled in a manner that makes it much more functional than Sparrow for iPhone running on the iPad in 2X mode.

* There are still a few showstoppers at this point in time, however, with message composition being the primary shortcoming. As of now, composing a new message relegates the message composition screen to a size that’s normally suited for the iPhone’s screen; a similar problem rears its head when trying to set up new email accounts.

* Besides those two significant issues, Sparrow looks and works surprisingly well on the iPad with SparrowPlus installed. If developer, @FreeManRepo, can get all of the kinks worked out, then SparrowPlus might be viable holdover until the developers of Sparrow themselves update the app with universal support.

* What do you think? Would you consider using Sparrow on the iPad once this updated tweak is released?
* Update: Yes, as it’s been noted by many of you, FullForce does the same thing, but the idea behind this is that it will fix many of the issues present with FullForce/Sparrow i.e. the message composition. Try downloading FullForce now if you want to give it a try.
