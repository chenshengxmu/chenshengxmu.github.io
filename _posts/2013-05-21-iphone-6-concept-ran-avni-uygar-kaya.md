* Here’s another next-generation iPhone concept, one that envisions a number of features unlikely to make their way into the handset. That of course didn’t prevent designers Uygar Kaya and Ran Avni from dreaming up the ultimate water and dust-resistant smartphone with notification LEDs, a full HD 1,920-by-1,080 widescreen display, 13-megapixel camera, touch-sensitive volume rocker, wireless charging and front-facing stereo speakers – all encases in an ultra-slim aluminum shell…
* And here’s a concept video.
* I’m not sure about water and dust-resistance, but I sure as hell hope Apple will upgrade the iPhone’s display to full HD.
* Yes, such a move would introduce a new resolutions for devs to target. On the other hand, Apple’s software development tools are now mature enough to make such transitions as painless as humanly possible.
* Despite naysayers, I’m convinced a full HD iPhone is on Apple’s roadmap. Given the vast majority of today’s movies, television shows and other video content is encoded in 1080p. In that regard, a full HD iPhone would render such content natively, without rescaling.
* As for wireless charging, I don’t care about it.

* Apple wireless charging rumors are surely plentiful and the company has filed for a number of patents detailing new ways of charging iOS devices.
* It’s not that the technology isn’t there – it is. But I just think wireless charging doesn’t really solve a problem as one still needs a wireless charging dock which has to be plugged into an electrical outlet.
* I’m pretty convinced the next iPhone will make major strides in the camera department and most checks give us reasons to believe the iPhone 5S will sport an upgraded, 13-megapixel camera with improved night shooting.
* As for notification LEDs, that’s one feature Apple won’t build – unfortunately, because I would love being able to see if new alerts have arrived just by glancing at my handset briefly.
* What next-gen iPhone features are you looking forward the most?
