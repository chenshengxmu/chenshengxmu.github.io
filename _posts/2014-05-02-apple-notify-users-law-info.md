* According to a new report from The Washington Post tonight, Apple will join Google and other high-profile companies in updating their privacy policy to routinely notify users when a government or law enforcement agency requests information on them.
* The move should appease user privacy rights activists, who believe it’s unlawful for a government agency to have the power to access user data so discretely. The Justice Department, however, is concerned that the new routine could threaten investigations…
* Here’s the report from The Post:
* Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Google all are updating their policies to expand routine notification of users about government data seizures, unless specifically gagged by a judge or other legal authority, officials at all four companies said. Yahoo announced similar changes in July.
* And here’s Apple’s statement on the change:
* “Later this month, Apple will update its policies so that in most cases when law enforcement requests personal information about a customer, the customer will receive a notification from Apple,” company spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said. 
* Of course, this is all still part of the ongoing fallout from last year’s PRISM scandal. In June, whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked a number of internal NSA documents incriminating Apple and other tech companies as members of a data surveillance program.
* All of the companies have since rebuffed the report, and several of them have launched a campaign to fight for greater transparency regarding government info requests. And judging by tonight’s report, it would seem that their efforts are yielding some results.
