* Arriving this Friday, Apple’s third-generation watch is seeing “significantly stronger” than expected demand, with the pricier LTE model accounting for the lion’s share of preorders.
* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in today’s note to clients, which was obtained by AppleInsider, that he estimates that Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + Cellular) has accounted for between 80 and 90 percent of preorders.
* He added that the new Apple Watch Series 3 models will help the wearable device reach some “significant marked shipment growth.” Before Apple’s keynote, KGI forecast the production weighting of the GPS + Cellular version would be 30-40 percent.
* The iPhone maker began accepting preorders for its new watch models last Friday.
* We conducted a poll on the new Apple devices from Apple’s keynote that iDownloadBlog readers are planning on buying and Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS + Cellular) came in second with about fifteen percent of votes (unsurprisingly, iPhone X was first).
* What new Apple device(s) will you buy?
* New orders for Apple Watch Series 3 are currently estimated to ship in three to four weeks, with the LTE version scheduled to arrive on October 2, according to the Apple Online Store.
* Having LTE connectivity on the new watch is a $70 premium over the Wi-Fi only models.
* In another report today, the analyst said that the forthcoming iPhone X has cannibalized some iPhone 8 orders even though the OLED device will be available for preorder from October 27 and won’t arrive before November 3 while iPhone 8 will drop as soon as this Friday.
