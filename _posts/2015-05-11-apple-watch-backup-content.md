* Whether you’ve just purchased your second or third Apple Watch, or have wiped your existing device clean, at some point you’ll probably want to restore it from a backup to continue right where you left off, especially if personalizing the device’s many settings all over again isn’t your definition of fun.
* A little planning ahead goes a long way toward being prepared so it may be a good idea to learn what is and what isn’t stored in your Apple Watch backup.
* Before we get to it, a little backgrounder on Apple Watch backups.
* A backup file is created when you unpair the Apple Watch from its connected iPhone. These backups are also part of your iPhone backups to iCloud or iTunes, assuming they’re enabled under Settings > iCloud > Backup or in desktop iTunes.
* You can use the Apple Watch companion app to restore the wearable device to your last-saved backup point. Restoring erases your Apple Watch and then recreates its content and settings from a backup.

* As mentioned before, Apple Watch backups are included as part of your iPhone backups to iCloud or iTunes, but you can’t view information in them for security reasons.
* At the time of this writing, desktop tools like iExplorer, iMazing, Phone Expander and others had not been updated with support for browsing Apple Watch backup data, stored on your Mac or Windows PC as part of iOS device backups created each time you sync your iPhone with iTunes.
