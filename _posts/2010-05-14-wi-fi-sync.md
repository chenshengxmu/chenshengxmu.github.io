title: Wirelessly Sync Your iPhone With iTunes With Wi-Fi Sync
---
* Wi-Fi Sync is a new application available in Cydia that enables seamless wireless syncing between your iPhone and iTunes.
* You may have heard of this application before. It made the headlines a couple weeks ago when it was submitted to the App Store. Obviously it wasn’t approved by Apple and it now is on Cydia for everyone to enjoy.
* To have Wi-Fi Sync work, you will have to download the $9.99 app and also the free software for Mac OS X. A Windows version should be available soon.
* Wi-Fi Sync works with the iPhone and iPod Touch but it doesn’t work with the iPad.
* Thanks Alex for the tip.
