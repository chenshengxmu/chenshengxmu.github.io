* As spotted by MacRumors, Apple TV has just gained a brand new channel with content from Sports Illustrated’s 120 SPORTS network.
* 120 SPORTS provides on-demand and streaming coverage from major sports networks, including content from the likes of MLB, NBA, NHL, PGA Tour, NCAA Football, NCAA Basketball, NASCAR and leading college leagues.
* It’s is an over-the-air update that doesn’t require a restart. If it’s not available on your box yet, choose Software Update in Apple TV’s Settings. The new channel arrives just a few weeks following the addition of the Tennis Channel Everywhere channel to the set-top box.
* Apple TV owners can fire up the 120 SPORTS channel to enjoy a collection of recent in-game highlights, as well as replays from its partner leagues, across Dashboard, Timeline and Catch-Up sections.
* For those not in the know, 120 SPORTS includes multiple leagues and media properties “created for the digital generation and the devices it uses most,” providing access to unauthenticated video programming with more than ten hours of free content being added on a daily basis.
* No cable subscription is required to fully enjoy 120 SPORTS content on your Apple TV. Though the channel is available now on the third-generation Apple TV, it’s yet to appear on the second-generation set-top box.
* 120 SPORTS also has a free iPhone and iPad app in the App Store.
