* Apple today seeded third betas of iOS 11.1, watchOS 4.1 and tvOS 11.1 to its registered developers and members of the Apple Developer Program.
* Matching betas for the company’s registered public beta testers should follow soon.
* Registered developers and beta testers can update their devices to the latest betas over the air via Apple’s standard Software Update mechanism in iOS Settings → General → Software Update, the Updates tab on Mac App Store, in tvOS Settings → System → Software Updates on their fourth or fifth-generation Apple TV and in the companion Watch app on iPhone.
* Apple originally released first betas for these forthcoming operating system software updates on September 27, followed by beta 2 on October 9.

* iOS 11.1 beta 2 brought back the popular 3D Touch app switcher gesture and included more than a hundred new emoji (also available in macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 and watchOS 4.1), including crazy face, shushing face, vampire, broccoli and more.
* Other improvements: no more haptic feedback on wrong passcode entry on the Lock screen, multiple emoji keyboard suggestions, new UI animations and visual tweaks in the Health app.
* Beta 2 of watchOS 4.1 introduced a Wi-Fi toggle in Control Center, a feature widely requested by the owners of cellular watches. The first beta of watchOS 4.1 brought with it a few outward-facing feature additions, such as a new Radio app and untethered streaming of Apple Music, Beats 1 and your iCloud Music Library.
* For the most part, macOS 10.13.1 and tvOS 11.1 appear to be focused on bug fixes.
* We’re installing the new betas to our devices and will report back any noteworthy changes. Feel free to report your own findings by shooting us a message at tips@iDownloadBlog.com or reach out to us on Twitter @iDownloadBlog.
