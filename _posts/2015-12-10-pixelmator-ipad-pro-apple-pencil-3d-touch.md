* Just two days after Pixelmator for Mac got updated with several new features, the iOS edition of the app has received a major update in the App Store this morning.
* Pixelmator 2.2 now works great on the iPad Pro and takes full advantage of Apple’s $99 Pencil stylus accessory. In addition, Pixelmator now includes full support for 3D Touch gestures on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.
* With 3D Touch, not only can you access Pixelmator’s Home screen shortcuts (Open Galley, Open From Photos and Create Image), but also paint directly in the app with pressure sensing. And if you 3D Touch an image in the gallery, you can access options to quickly preview, duplicate, share, delete or copy the image to the Photos app. Pressing deeper takes you to full screen.
