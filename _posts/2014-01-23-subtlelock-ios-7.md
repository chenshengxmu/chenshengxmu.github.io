* One of the better looking Lock screen tweaks for iOS 6 now has an iOS 7 counterpart. SubtleLock (iOS 7) is a brand new jailbreak tweak that allows you to make subtle changes to the Lock screen in iOS.
* The idea behind the tweak is to make the Lock screen appear simpler, less cluttered and easy to read. SubtleLock was one of my favorite lock screen tweaks available for previous iOS firmware, and I’m happy to report that this new tweak works just as well as past iterations. Full video walkthrough inside.
* Once you install SubtleLock (iOS 7), you’ll find the preferences for the tweak nestled in the stock Settings app. Inside the tweak’s preferences are three sections for Clock, Slider, and Appearance.
* SubtleLock’s biggest feature, in my opinion at least, is its ability to reduce the size and location of the Lock screen clock. By reducing the clock’s unnecessary dominance, the Lock screen appears much less cluttered and busy.
* SubtleLock brings a certain elegance to the iOS 7 Lock screen

* All of SubtleLock’s settings, the ability to change label colors, hide the date, remove the Notification Center and Control Center grabbers, and more, can be done without needing a respring. For a tweak like this, it’s important to be able to quickly check the results of your changes, so the fact that it doesn’t require a respring is a huge plus.
* SubtleLock iOS 7 is $1 and available right now for download on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Be sure to share your thoughts and comments regarding the tweak down below.
