* Tis the season to spend an incredible amount of money on people you love, and like every year, you are confronted with the same problem: “what am I going to get for my lovely wife?” Or, “should I get him a tie like I did for the last 4 years?” I’ve been there, believe me.
* Because I suspect there are many of you out there who still aren’t sure what to get for your loved ones, we’ve decided to come up with the iDB gift guides, where each iDB team member will list a few gift ideas. It may be Apple products, accessories, apps, or just about anything else…

* Let’s start with the obvious gift. Not the cheapest one, but something that’s sure to be a hit when unwrapping gifts by the Christmas tree on the morning of the 25th. Not only it is beautiful, but it’s also the most powerful iPhone yet, while still sporting an amazing battery life, far superior to any iPhone I have owned before. The taller screen, thinner and lighter design make it my all time favorite Apple device. The iPhone 5 makes for the perfect gift, especially for someone who doesn’t have an iPhone yet, or has been using an older model. It starts at $199 with a two year contract.

* In case you haven’t read my iPad mini review, let me give you the quick pitch. After my iPhone 5, this is my favorite Apple device. As a matter of fact, I retired my iPad 3, which is now sitting on a shelf behind my desk, and I only use my iPad mini. It is the perfect size for everything I do, which usually is emailing, reading, editing photos, tweeting, and browsing the web. Yes, yes, I know, it doesn’t have a Retina display, but to be honest, I’m already over this. Besides, if you’re offering an iPad mini to someone who never owned an iPad, the lack of Retina display will not be an issue. The iPad mini start at $329.

* Over the past year, I have developed a taste and creative craving for iPhone photography, and judging by the feedback we’re getting on our iPhoneography series, I believe many of you feel the same way. I decided to put together the iPhoneography pack, a bundle of accessories, and apps for you to gift to someone. As far as accessories go, I can recommend the OlloClip lens sytem ($70), the Glif tripod mount ($20), and the GorillaPod tripod ($20). You can also gift your loved one our collection of best iPhone photo apps, as well as iDB resident iPhoneographers Justin Balog’s iBook Big World Little Lens.

* I can hardly hide my love for iCarbons skins. Ever since I tried them a few months ago, I got hooked. They look gorgeous, are made of high quality 3M materials, and as if it wasn’t enough, I got to meet the iCarbons folks at JailbreakCon this year, and I can attest that they are pretty awesome. As we speak, I have 2 iPhones and 3 iPads sporting iCarbons skins. I love them because they look beautiful but also because they protect the back of my devices. A great and inexpensive gift for anyone who owns an iPhone or iPad. Skins start at $14.

* Living in California, I mostly wear sandals all year long. However, there are times when I must wear shoes and when I do, I usually wear my favorite brand: Onitsuka Tiger by Asics. Onitsuka Tiger is one of the oldest Japanese shoe company. It became Asics in 1972 when it merged with two other companies. I absolutely love the look of these shoes. That’s not the kind of shoes you want to wear when going for a run, but it’s perfect for a night out in town. I recently bought the grey Mexico 66 model. You can find different models on Zappos, stating at $50.

* A great inexpensive gift for anyone who owns an iPhone is the GLAS.t, a screen protector made of glass which I recently reviewed. Unlike most screen protectors made of plastic, the GLAS.t feels like it’s not there. You can barely see it, but most importantly, it feels exactly the same as your iPhone screen when you touch it. Some think it’s a pain in the butt to install, but I never had any problem with it in the past. The GLAS.t is available for the iPhone 5 and previous iPhone models for $28.

* I’ve been sitting pretty much all day long in front of my computer for the past few years, which has led my back to take a serious toll. My lower back feels all tight and my posture is terrible, which often leads to pain in the back of my legs. I’ve been practicing yoga for a while and I have to say it’s doing wonders on my body. I recently joined Core Power Yoga, a large chain that has studios all over the country, allowing you to attend classes in any studio (great for travelers). I can’t recommend yoga enough, whether it is Core Power or any other studio. I suggest you gift a one-month membership or a pack of 10 classes. Prices vary per studio.
* I hope these suggestions will give you some ideas. If none of them work for you, don’t worry, the rest of the iDB team will also be coming up with their gift recommendations.
