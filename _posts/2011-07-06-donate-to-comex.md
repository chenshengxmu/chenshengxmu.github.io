title: If You Used JailbreakMe, Maybe You Should Consider Making a Donation to Comex
---
* With over 500,000 iDevices jailbroken with JailbreakMe Saffron since last night, can you imagine if Comex made $1 for each of these devices? Yes, he’d probably be flying first class to some Caribbean island by now.

* But let’s be realistic, not everyone would want to pay for a jailbreak, even if it was as low as one dollar. Truth is, most people probably don’t even know they can donate to Comex, which is why we thought it was our duty to let everyone know that they can…
* If you used JailbreakMe to jailbreak one or more of your devices, the right thing to do would be to make a small donation to Comex. He’s been working on this jailbreak for almost a year and has probably spent hundreds of hours on it. The least we can do is to give a little financial support. Anything helps: $0.10, $0.50, $1, $10. Give whatever you can.
* Not only this will be a much deserved reward, but that will most likely encourage Comex to keep working on those exploits.
