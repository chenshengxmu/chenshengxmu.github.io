* Apple would like you to give the gift of music this holiday season so the company yesterday published its first holiday ad on YouTube, just in time for Thanksgiving.
* Titled “Sway” and running one minute and 40 seconds long, the ad invites viewers to “move someone this holiday.” Featuring an acrobatic dance performance set in a winter holiday setting, the video shows a girl dancing around town and listening to music on her AirPods.
* Song: “Palace” by Sam Smith
* After bumping into a male dancer, she shares one of her earphones with the the male lead.
* AirPods are obviously the key to romance in this ad as the two dancers continue their performance under a spotlight until they almost kiss.

* Apple has some of the best holiday and Christmas ads that I’ve seen and this moving video is no exception—I especially liked how they coupled fantasy ballet concept with romance.
* If I’m not mistaken, this commercial appears to have been filmed in the Czech Republic in Prague, just like Apple’s Christmas ad last year.
* How do you like Apple’s holiday ad?
