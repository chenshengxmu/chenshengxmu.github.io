* If you believe certain analysts, supply chain chatter and reports from outlets like Mac Otakara, Apple’s next iPhone will feature an all-digital, touch-sensitive Home button flush with its front face. A pair of new rumors, first discovered by AppleInsider, have now reaffirmed that the iPhone 7’s non-moving Home button won’t physically click when pressed, instead simulating a click with vibration much like the trackpad on MacBooks uses haptic feedback to provide a click sensation.
* New reports from Chinese outlet Storm.mg and the reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara claim that the new Home button will no longer physically depress when pushed, speculating the solution would aid in making the device thinner and more waterproof.
* It’s unclear if the reengineered Home button would also sense pressure. Prior rumors have made claims that a future iPhone may hide Touch ID, the proximity and ambient light sensor, the earpiece and the front-facing FaceTime camera behind the display.
* Finally, the Mac Otakara report has reaffirmed previous rumors alleging that the forthcoming device, which may be called ‘iPhone 6SE’ and should launch on September 19, would be offered in the existing Silver, Space Gray, Gold and Rose Gold colorways, in addition to a new dark shade of black “akin to the latest Mac Pro”.
* The 4.7-inch iPhone 7 is said to include an improved camera with optical image stabilization, a feature previously found only on the flagship 5.5-inch model which itself should gain a dual-camera for better zoom and 3GB of RAM.
* Other rumored features of this year’s iPhone refresh include an Apple-designed ‘A10’ chip, stereo sound, pro-class waterproofing, no 3.5mm headphone jack and more. Deutsche Bank predicted that the new phones would ship with a Lightning-to-audio dongle in the box as Lightning-enabled EarPods are believed to be sold separately.
