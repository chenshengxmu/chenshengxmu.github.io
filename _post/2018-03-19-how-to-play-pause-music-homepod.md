* Siri is the primary input method on your HomePod.
* With Siri, you can do things like ask for a specific song, request detailed information about the currently playing track, pause or resume music playback and much, much more.
* In order to ensure smooth user experience in terms of music, which is HomePod’s forte, Apple has made it possible to control the music playing on your HomePod from multiple devices.
* In addition to Siri voice commands, you can also use HomePod’s touch controls to pause or resume audio, plus the Home app, Control Center, Now Playing and more.
* To pause or resume music on HomePod with Siri, just say:

* Aside from using Siri, HomePod supports a variety of touch-based actions that you can use to control music playback on the device if Siri is unavailable, disconnected or acting up.

* As evidenced by the list above, you have other music-related touch controls at your disposal. For example, you can double-tap the HomePod top to skip to the following track or podcast chapter while triple-tapping takes you to the beginning of the track or the previous track.
* This isn’t the most obvious solution, but it works and is only a tap away—which may be a boon for heavy HomeKit users who happen to be spending a lot of time in the Home app.
* 1) Open the Home app on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 11.2.5 or later.
* 2) In the Home or Rooms tab, tap your HomePod’s icon once to instantly pause the currently playing song. Tap the HomePod icon again to send your HomePod a Resume command.
* You can also pause and resume music playing through your HomePod from the Home widget in Control Center on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 11.2.5 or later.
* 1) Open Settings on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap Control Center.
* 3) Tap Customize Controls.
* 4) If the widget for the Home app is not already present in Control Center, add it by tapping the green “+” sign next to Home in the section headlined More Controls.

* When HomePod is playing audio, its Control Center widget displays a white tile.
* When the device pauses/stops music, the Control Center tile turns transparent. The word “Playing” or “Paused” appears inside the tile to further indicate the status of your HomePod.
* TIP: If your HomePod is absent from Control Center, you must favorite it in the Home app: tap the Home or Rooms tab, tap or press with 3D Touch your HomePod, choose Details and slide the Include in Favorites toggle to the ON position.

* If you use Apple’s local media-streaming technology, called AirPlay, to route audio from an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch, Mac or Apple TV through your HomePod, you can use onscreen controls to pause or resume music playing on the speaker.
* Launch your favorite music or video-streaming app, start playing something, then tap the AirPlay icon in the player to access the list of AirPlay-compatible devices on your local network. Choose your HomePod from the list to send audio to the speaker.

* To pause or resume your music, use the corresponding audio controls in the app from which you’re AirPlaying to this HomePod. You can AirPlay audio from any device or app that has not disabled AirPlay streaming on purpose. A savvy user would typically AirPlay audio to their HomePod from such apps like Spotify, YouTube, Netflix, Pandora and so forth.

* Some apps may incorporate a slightly different user interface for picking the output device.
* In Spotify for iPhone, for example, you must tap on where it says Devices Available and choose the More Devices option from the popup menu in order to get to a popup modal with options to choose from Bluetooth or AirPlay speakers, including your HomePod.
* You can use the AirPlay method in conjunction with your HomePod with any device that does AirPlay, be it your Apple Watch or Mac, an iOS device or even your Apple TV.
