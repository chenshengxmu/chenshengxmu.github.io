* Apple on Tuesday held its annual shareholder meeting at its Cupertino headquarters. The gathering is standard affair—company executives and board members meet with stockholders to discuss a wide range of topics, including performance and proposals.
* The most interesting part of today’s meeting, however, was Tim Cook’s informal Q&A session. The casual section allows attending shareholders to offer up their questions and comments to the CEO and other members of the company’s senior leadership team.
* The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple attended the event, and jotted down some of Cook’s more noteworthy comments. Among them was his statement about iPhone sales: “Our goal has never been to sell the most, but sell the best. But we did sell the most last quarter.”
* Here are some others:
* 2017 could end up being a significant year for Apple. Rumor has it that the company is planning a Spring event to unveil new iPads and perhaps new iPhone models, and of course no one can stop talking about the iPhone 8 that’s expected to launch this fall.
