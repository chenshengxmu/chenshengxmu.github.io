* ESPN today refreshed its app on App Store with an overhauled user interface on Apple TV and other features. Renamed from WatchESPN to just ESPN, the free of charge universal binary now works across your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV and Apple Watch. It now supports auto-playing live streams, replays and full episodes of on-demand content. The app is rolling out today so check back later if it’s not live yet on your local App Store.
* Provided you sign in with your cable or satellite account, you can enjoy a wide range of live and on-demand video on the ESPN app on the fourth-generation Apple TV. The app provides on-demand access to hundreds of hours of additional content from 30 for 30, E:60, Outside the Lines, SC Featured, World Series of Poker, X Games and more.

* Aside from a sleeker user interface, the app now shows a live stream of one of its networks as soon as you launch it on your Apple TV, provided you’re an authenticated user. You can also browse videos by Sports & Events or Channels and more.
