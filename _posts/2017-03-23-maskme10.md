* Privacy is a big concern for a number of people, and one of the things that can be considered an invasion of this simple right is when people look over your shoulder to see what and who you’re texting.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called MaskMe10 by RIshanan gives you some peace of mind by providing you with masking options for your incoming message notifications.
* If from a first glance this tweak sounds similar to a recent release dubbed NotifyCensored, or if you’re already thinking to yourself, “well iOS already does this out of the box,” then you may want to keep reading, because you will find that MaskMe10 works differently.
* This tweak lets you filter incoming message notifications from certain people or that contain certain keywords. If a message you receive meets either of the aforementioned criteria, then the tweak will mask your notification with any customized placeholder text you want. If it doesn’t meet either of the criteria, then you’ll see the notification as it was intended to be displayed in the first place.
* You can configure the tweak from the Settings app, where you’ll find a new preferences pane dedicated strictly to MaskMe10’s filtering options:

* Here, you’re be met with a switch for toggling the tweak on or off, as well as toggle switches for each of the individual features. Under each section, you can choose your filters; the tweak gives you filtering options based on both name and message content.
* To hide messages from certain people, you can simply enter their name (separate multiple names by semicolons) into the name field. Then, choose a name you want to appear in its place instead whenever someone with a saved name messages you.
* To hide messages containing certain a keyword(s), you will enter the keyword (separate multiple words by semicolons) into the content field, and the tweak will filter any messages that contain your predefined word(s) and replace the message content with your chosen placeholder text instead.
* The way the tweak works is pretty clever, as it gives you a way to mask messages that may be sensitive in two ways while still maintaining the integrity of non-sensitive notifications so that they appear normally. This, in and of itself, is a step above Apple’s own Messages notification privacy setting, which forces you to filter all or nothing.
* If you’re interested in trying MaskMe10, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today. The tweak is compatible with jailbroken iOS 10 devices, and the developer even notes that the tweak works with SleekNotifications, a tweak that makes banner notifications more compact.
