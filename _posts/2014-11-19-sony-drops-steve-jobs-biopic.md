* Sony Pictures has dropped the highly-anticipated Steve Jobs biopic penned by Aaron Sorkin, according to Deadline. The outlet reports tonight that Sony has put the film in turnaround—meaning that another studio can purchase the movie.
* It sounds like that studio is going to be Universal. Deadline’s Mike Fleming Jr says he is hearing that the Comcast subsidiary is nearing an agreement, and the deal could close by tomorrow, meaning the project should lose little momentum.
* There’s no word on why Sony decided to back out, although the film has had some issues nailing down an actor for the lead role. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Christian Bale were attached to play Jobs at one point, but neither actor signed on.
* Rumor has it that Michael Fassbender, of Prometheus fame, is now in talks to play Steve Jobs, and comedian Seth Rogen is being considered for the part of Steve Wozniak. Danny Boyle is directing, and production is expected to begin soon.
