* You know CafePress, the online source for custom merchandise such as T-Shirts, mugs, and pretty much anything else you can think of. Yesterday they announced the launch of custom iPhone cases, ready to be designed with your own photos or artwork.
* Beginning today, you can shop from a catalog of over 100,000 user-generated custom iPhone 4 cases with thousands of designs, ranging from political to funny to artistic and everything in betweenâ€¦
* In addition to offering iPhone cases with community generated designs, CafePress has also launched a simple iPhone case designer tool that allows you to easily upload photos or other digital art to create your very own custom iPhone case.
* So far, only cases for iPhone 4 are available but from what I understand, CafePress will soon have cases for the iPhone 3GS as well.
* These cases are currently pre-selling at $19.99 â€“ the regular price is $25. You can get a user-generated case here or make your own here.
* Or even better, you can enter to win one of the 5 free iPhone cases that CafePress is giving away to iDB readers. To enter, simply follow these instructions:
* We will choose 5 winners by the end of the week. Winners will be notified via Facebook messages with instructions on how to get their custom case.
* Good luck ðŸ™‚
