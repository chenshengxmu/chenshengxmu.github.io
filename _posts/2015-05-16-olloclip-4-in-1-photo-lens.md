* If you fancy yourself an iPhone photographer and are looking for some accessories to make your hobby more interesting, lenses work great for creating a wider variety of looks.
* The Olloclip 4-in-1 Photo Lens kit provides a fisheye, wide-angle, and two different macro lenses that attach to your iPhone 6, giving you a multitude of picture taking options.
* The 4-in-1 lens kit comes in two sets that are screwed together. In one set you get the fisheye lens. Unscrew it to reveal the Macro 15X. The other set includes the wide-angle and the Macro 10X. The lenses screw and unscrew onto either side of the Olloclip clip.
* The clip itself snaps right onto the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus with no additional parts. All you will need to do is snap the compatibility insert into place. There is one for the iPhone 6 and one for the iPhone 6 Plus. The newly designed clip now works with both the front and rear-facing cameras so you can take interesting personal pics, as well.
* The kit also comes with three different colored pendants that can be clipped to a lanyard or a keychain. That way, you will always have your lens kit with you.
* Because the clip fits snugly on your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, you canâ€™t use the clip with a case on it. So, if you are particularly close with your case, keep that in mind.
* The Olloclip 4-in-1 Photo Lens kit costs $80 on Amazon and comes in silver with a black or white clip, gray with a black clip, or gold with a white clip. All colors include a pendant that matches the clip, plus an additional blue and green pendant, as well as a lanyard.
