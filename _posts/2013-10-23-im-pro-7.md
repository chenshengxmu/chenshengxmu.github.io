title: IM+ Pro7 with clean and simple iOS 7 design now available in App Store
---
* IM+ Pro has been one of the most popular chat clients in the App Store for a couple of years. One of the best features is encrypted peer-to-peer chatting, which can be added with an in-app purchase. The app has seen many updates and still works great. However, sometimes, new is better.

* IM+ Pro7 is the next version of the feature-rich chat client. The user interface has been completely redesigned, comes with off-the-record encryption, and offers free text and messaging in most social networking services, all in one convenient app…
* The app still offers users the ability to chat in Skype, Facebook, Twitter DM, Google +, Yahoo Chat, and many more. Log into your various accounts to access your contacts, buddies, and co-workers. Then, start a chat on any of your contacts and hold multiple conversations at one time. You can even have multiple conversations going under the same account at the same time.

* If you are looking to make new friends, you can find out more about people around you using “Neighbors.” The location-based friend finder allows you to participate in group chats, “shout” to your neighbor, and find out more about what is going on in your community.
* Send and receive text messages, photos, videos, and voice notes. Store your chat histories and access them from any web browser. Keep your chats private using Off-the-Record. You can even print out your chats using AirPrint from within the app.
* Customize the way your chat window looks using different themes, backgrounds, custom sound notifications, and emoticons. Be alerted when someone is starting to type. Have the app send you push notifications so you know when you are getting a new email messages from Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, and AOL.

* The reason IM+ Pro7 costs $4.99 instead of being a free app is that the items that are available as an in-app purchase in IM+ Pro are included in this version. That means, you’ll get peer-to-peer off-the-record encrypted chats and Beep, the service’s mobile-to-mobile messenger, included with the download price. You are getting both at a discounted price with the iOS 7 update. Of course, IM+ Pro is still available in the App Store if you don’t want to pay for the additional features. IM+ Pro7 is available for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Download it in the App Store today.
