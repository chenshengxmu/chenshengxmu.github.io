* Baseball fans will be happy to hear that MLB.com has updated its At the Ballpark iOS app this morning. The update brings the client to version 3.o, and features an all-new design for iOS 7 and support for Apple’s new ‘iBeacon’ tech that will be available in select ballparks this year.
* We’ve known for a while now that Major League Baseball was working with Apple on its geolocation technology, which its Advanced Media group demonstrated last fall. And the organization has said it hopes to roll out the feature to at least 20 parks ahead of 2014’s Opening Day…
* Here are the release notes for version 3.0:
* MLB.com At The Ballpark is your mobile companion when visiting your favorite Major League Baseball ballparks. The official MLB ballpark application perfectly complements and personalizes the trip with mobile check-in, social media, offers, rewards and exclusive content. Select MLB ballparks also offer mobile food ordering and merchandise ordering and seat and experience upgrade components. New for 2014, check in automatically with iBeacon technology at select ballparks for exclusive offers and in-game features.
* 2014 Features:
* – Check in for offers and rewards and personalized history for ballparks visited – Team schedule, directions and parking information, social media clubhouse and more – Interactive concourse maps and directory, including food and drinks menus – Ballpark and player entrance music info, with the ability to purchase songs on iPhone – See team videos, plus watch video highlights from games attended – Seat and experience upgrade functionality is available at select ballparks
* And here’s another screenshot of the app:

* For those unfamiliar with iBeacon, it’s a geolocation technology Apple unveiled last summer. When using ‘iBeacons,’ retailers and other outlets can tell where a person is in a venue within a few feet, and then send alerts and other content to their smartphones based on their position.
* MLB ballparks are hoping the tech will enhance the ‘fan experience’ by offering directions to seats, restrooms and nearby food and drink stands, as well as other points of interest. They could use the app to offer time or location-based coupons. Ex: ‘$2 off hot dogs through 7th inning.’
* We know that ballparks in LA and San Diego have already been equipped with iBeacons, but we have yet to see a full list of participating stadiums. Still, with Opening Day now just a few days away, you may want to grab ‘MLB.com At the Ballpark’ from the App Store just in case. It’s free.
