* It seems like every time there’s a new version of iOS released, users find a way to utilize glitches to their advantage. We all remember the Newsstand glitch found in iOS 6, and various other glitches and tricks to hide folders, apps, nest folders, etc.
* Similar glitches were discovered to work in the beta version of iOS 7, and many of them remain in the final build. In the video that follows, I’ll show you how to use these glitches to hide apps, hide folders, and to nest folders within folders.
* No, it’s not the most ideal method for achieving such results, but until we get a jailbreak, or until Apple allows end users to further customize their device, this will have to do.
* Nesting folders is extremely easy to pull off, here’s how it’s done:
* Step 1: Place two folders on the same Home screen
* Step 2: Tap and hold on the folder that you wish to move, and immediately press the Home button twice to invoke the app switcher
* Step 3: Tap the first app switcher page to get back to the Home screen
* Step 4: Tap the folder where you want to move your initially selected folder
* Step 5: Press the Home button once, and the folder should move into the receiving folder
* Hiding folders and hiding apps follows the exact same formula outside of a few subtle differences:
* Step 1: Place a folder on the first Home screen page, full of apps
* Step 2: Place the folder or app that you wish to hide in the dock
* Step 3: Tap the folder or app that you wish to hide and immediately double press the Home button to invoke the app switcher
* Step 4: Tap the first app switcher page to get back to the Home screen
* Step 5: Tap the folder where you want to move your initially selected folder
* Step 6: Tap outside the folder to close the folder
* Step 7: Press the Home button once, and the app or folder that you initially selected should disappear completely
* You can easily reset all of your folders and apps by simply rebooting your device. You can also still launch hidden apps by using the Spotlight search option.
* As stated at the outset, it’s not the most ideal solution for managing apps and folders on iOS 7, but it’s the best thing we have right now. Shout out to Dom over at App Advice for reminding us about such a nifty little glitch.
