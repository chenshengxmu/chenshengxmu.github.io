* Despite the slowness of the jailbreak community as of late in the midst of no new jailbreak, Cydia is still seeing a number of tweak releases throughout each week.
* Every Sunday we bring you our roundup of all the jailbreak tweaks and apps released in Cydia this week, and this weekend is no different.
* In this roundup, we’ll show you our favorite Cydia releases first and then talk about some of the others.
* CarPlay iOS 2.0 was released this week to let jailbreakers emulate the CarPlay user interface on their iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad.
* It offers a number of features, including support for Google Maps and Spotify, as well as the ability to customize different modes that make the tweak more practical for users who want to use their device as an actual CarPlay device instead of spending the money to purchase a CarPlay-enabled head unit.
* CarPlay iOS has most of the unique interface qualities you would expect from a realistic CarPlay head unit and all of the UI is fully functional.
* You can read our full review on CarPlay iOS 2.0 to learn more about the way it works.

* Hate how you can’t send images in direct messages from the Tweetbot 4 app? Delen for Tweetbot will fix this for you.
* The tweak adds what looks like native image sending abilities to the Tweetbot 4 app in the direct messaging interface.
* Unfortunately, Twitter limits this feature to the stock Twitter app only, do the app developer wouldn’t be able to add it if he wanted to, or else he’d risk having his app pulled from the App Store, but if you’re jailbroken, you can circumvent the entire thing by just installing this tweak.
* You can read our full review of Delen for Tweetbot to learn more about how it works and why Twitter limits this to the stock app.
* LINE One Touch Call: Lets you make a LINE call with just one shortcut tap (free)
* NoInviteFBMessenger: Keeps Facebook Messenger from badgering you to invite friends (free – review)
* SearchDefine: Lets you define words via the iOS dictionary from Spotlight ($0.99 – review)
* Although that’s all we have for this week, you can still look back on last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup to see if you’ve missed anything.
* We will continue to share the jailbreak tweaks of the week posts as long as jailbreak tweaks are being produced, so check back with us again next week for more!
