* As promised, Google-owned Waze has been updated with support for Ford’s SYNC 3 protocol.
* Apple users can now pair their copy of Waze for iPhone through AppLink with any Ford vehicle using SYNC, the auto maker’s hands-free entertainment and vehicle information system.
* “Driving a Ford or Lincoln? Plug in your phone and drive with Waze on your in-car display (SYNC 3 version 3.0 required),” according to release notes accompanying Waze for iOS’s 4.38.1 version. To learn more about the SYNC protocol and Waze integration, visit the Ford website.
* Waze supports all of the popular features provided by the SYNC software, including the Speedometer, HOV route support and “Talk to Waze” voice control.
* This integration is currently available on iOS.

* iOS 11.3 or newer is required for Waze integration with Ford SYNC.
* Keep in mind that Waze won’t work on SYNC 3 unless you manually switch off CarPlay. In other words, you can have either CarPlay or SYNC 3 apps, but not both at the same time.
* TWEAK: FarewellGestureWaze disable Waze’s menu-based swipe gesture
* The crowdsourced navigation app supports 2018 vehicles with Ford’s newest infotainment systems. Older vehicles will get support for Waze through a firmware update that the owner will need to install manually over USB.
* Unfortunately, Apple currently does not allow third-party mapping applications to use CarPlay, which means if you prefer Waze, Google Maps or others, you are basically out of luck.
* Waze is a free download from App Store.
