* Safari for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac allows you to save any webpage as your Favorite. This is helpful for one-tap access to Favorites: any website filed into a custom bookmark folder which you have designated to store Favorites becomes readily available below the address field when you create a new tab, enter a URL or search.
* Safari ships with a default Favorites folder where you put websites you frequent, such as iDownloadBlog, but its location can be adjusted to your liking.
* In this quick tutorial, we’re going to explain how you can designate any of your bookmark folders as Safari’s Favorites.
* One reason this setting could make you more productive could be the separation of work and home content. You could, for example, set up two Favorites folders—one for work and the other for play—to switch between on a whim.
* Safari will instantly scan the new Favorites location and display appropriate website thumbnails when new tabs are created or the search bar is interacted with.
* To select a bookmark folder as your new Favorites location, follow the steps below. Keep in mind that this has to be done separately on each iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac you own as this particular setting does not sync via iCloud.
* Step 1: Open Settings on your iOS device.
* Step 2: Tap on the Safari section.
* Step 3: Now tap on the Favorites option under the General heading.

* Step 4: Lastly, select a bookmark folder to set as your Favorites.
* As mentioned, you can quickly access your Favorites when you enter an address, search or create a new tab, as shown right below.

* As a bonus, your Favorites always top Safari’s Bookmarks list.
* People who own an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus can press an entry in Favorites to quickly preview the website without opening it.

* If you have not created any custom bookmark folders yet, hit Safari’s Bookmarks button next to the Share icon, choose Bookmarks at the top and tap Edit.
* Now tap New Folder to create a new folder inside Safari’s bookmarks. You’ll need to set a folder title and location. To save your changes, go back to the previous screen and tap Done.

* If Safari is enabled in Settings → iCloud, folders, bookmarked websites and other Safari data will be kept in perfect sync across all your devices.
* Step 1: Launch Safari on your Mac.
* Step 2: Choose Preferences in the Safari menu.
* Step 3: Click on the General tab.

* Step 4: Choose a custom folder for your Favorites in a drop-down menu next to the section labeled “Favorites shows”.
* Again, your Favorites will conveniently appear when you click Safari’s address field to enter a URL or run a search query…

* Tip: Safari for Mac lets you launch new tabs with either Top Sites or Favorites. To switch between either of them at any time, just open a new tab and click the star icon (Favorites) or the grid icon (Top Sites) in the top-right corner of the window.
* And that’s it, folks, you can now designate any custom folder in Safari’s Bookmarks as your Favorites like a boss.
