* Apple’s Find My iPhone service is rather convenient for finding a lost device, but it falls short in theft prevention. See, thieves have figured out by now they simply need to shut down a stolen device to stop Find My iPhone.
* Cabel Sasser thought of an interesting solution – a “Shutdown Requires PIN” feature in iOS Settings – and carrier AT&T’s also been tackling this problem for some time.
* It looks like the nation’s leading carrier, which sold 17.5 million iPhones last year, has indeed come up with an effective remedy that might keep iPhone thieves on the grid longer: a block list of sorts on the network end…
* Louis Goddard, reporting for The Verge, lays it all out:
* AT&T will launch a new service for reporting and blocking stolen devices on Tuesday, July 10, according to a trusted source.
* The service will allow customers to deny voice, data and SMS access to any individual phone or tablet while keeping their account intact, avoiding the inconvenience of a full SIM block.
* The carrier already informed its customer service representatives that its servers will automatically suspend service “if any attempt is made to use a device that is stored in the blocklist.” Users will need to contact a customer service representative directly in order to re-enable service.
* Also, “users with remote data wipe apps will be required to activate them before suspending their device, to prevent access to their personal information”.
* AT&T’s new service is likely a part of of a Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) initiative from April which promised to create a joint database that would keep track of stolen handsets and those reported as lost.
* According to FCC, a whopping forty percent of all robberies in major metropolitan areas are mobile devices, especially pricey and popular gadgets such as the iPhone and iPad.
* I’ve always wondered why carriers never tapped their back-end to prevent device theft, or make it inconvenient at the least. AT&T’s solution struck me as the most effective yet, though I wished AT&T worked more closely with device vendors to really tighten security.
* For example, I’d love to be able to use Find My iPhone to directly lock my stolen device on the network end, without wasting time on paperwork with a carrier.
* What do you think?
* Speaking of Find My iPhone: please, rename it to reflect the fact it supports all iOS devices, not just iPhones.
