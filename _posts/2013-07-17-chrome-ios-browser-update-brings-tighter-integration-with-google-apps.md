* The Internet giant Google has just pushed a major update to its Chrome browser for the iPhone and iPad, sporting better voice capabilities and containing a whole bunch of new features that make the browser fully interoperable with major Google apps available on the iOS platform.
* In addition to advanced voice control achieved through additional enhancements to voice search and improved text-to-speech, this edition of the Chrome 28 build boasts tight interoperability with Google’s other native apps on iOS.
* For starters, there’s a handy option to open links for YouTube, Maps, Google+ and Drive in Google’s native iOS apps instead of the browser. On the iPad side, there’s a new full-screen browsing mode (finally) along with other tidbits, mentioned after the break…
* Toolbar controls are now always visible when using voice search and text-to-speech is provided for all variations of English, Spanish, German, Italian, French, Japanese, and Korean.
* “Today’s release of Chrome for iPad and iPhone makes it easier to integrate your favorite Google apps with Chrome”, the company wrote in a blog post. “After you sign in to Chrome, you can sign in to other Google apps with a single click”.
* Of course, you’ll have to install other Google iOS apps to take advantage of this integration. I typically watch a bunch of clips on any given day so it’s awesome that I can now tell Chrome to open YouTube links in Google’s native app.
* The feature works nicely with the just-updated Google Maps application.

* You’d be advised to enable Maps integration in Chrome settings because following directions using a Google Maps web app in Safari is way too cumbersome and sluggish.
* Google isn’t stopping with Maps, YouTube, Google+ and Google Drive as support for more apps is “coming soon”.
* As for iPad users, they’ll be delighted to know Chrome finally supports full-screen browsing and lets them access their browsing history from the Chrome menu.
