* Ming-Chi Kuo, arguably the most reliable Apple analyst out there who had been breaking major news about the Cupertino tech giant for years, has departed KGI Securities.
* The analyst quit KGI on Friday.
* He is moving on to greener pastures for a job with another firm, according to a report by The China Times newspaper (Google Translate). Prior to this, Kuo worked as an analyst for Concord Securities and as a senior analyst at the Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes.
* He joined KGI in 2012, as per his LinkedIn profile.
* The news prompted media watchers to speculate he would focus on other companies, which is probably true. Kuo’s track record in terms of deciphering Apple’s moves—though not perfect—is way better versus other analysts because he obviously has some pretty solid sources entrenched in the Taiwanese supply chain and likely within Apple as well.
* Congratulations to Ming Chi-Kuo (the best analyst covering Apple) who is leaving KGI for another firm, and reportedly moving on to cover innovative non-Apple companies. https://t.co/m55yUVQSGG

* It’s very interesting that Kuo has kept an extremely low profile during the nearly six and a half years spent covering Apple at KGI. He shies away from doing interviews and has no presence on social media. The photograph of Kuo you see top of post is one of a few headshots of him that we were able to find online by running reverse image lookup using his photo.
* KGI files as Taiwan’s second-largest securities firm. They’ve been in business for quite some time now and are set to mark their 30th anniversary later this September.
* Might Apple have anything to do with Kuo’s decision to step down, do you think?
* Chime in with your thoughts in the comments section down below.
