* With the new ARKit framework for building augmented reality (AR) apps, Apple is turning existing iOS devices into the largest AR platform in the world.
* We previously shared a bunch of interesting ARKit demos showcasing the possibilities of the framework, including an upcoming furniture-ordering app from Ikea, a measuring tape, an ARKit-powered VR mode in Maps and more.
* Today, we’re highlight three more examples of ARKit-driven apps: a Tesla Model 3 app by an impatient fan, an example of an inter-dimensional portal in the middle of the street and an app that promises to change how we order food.
* First up, a demo app by an impatient Tesla fan who couldn’t wait for his ordered Model 3 so he made this ARKit-powered app that lets him drive around a virtual Model 3 in his real world, activate the headlights and so forth.
* @elonmusk Couldn’t wait 4 my #Model3, so made this AR app, what do you think? #ARkit pic.twitter.com/lIRLTZox7N

* Food ordering will never be the same, says developer Alper Guler who created an ARKit-driven app which renders various foods on your table that you can pan around, zoom in and out, rotate and more.
* And last but not least, we have French consulting agency Nedd which came up with a great example of AR+VR, via iPhoneAddict.fr.
* Before signing off, here’s a quick volumetric capture example with ARKit.
