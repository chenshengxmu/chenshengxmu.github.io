* The app also lets you create a custom playlist of your favorite teams and provides direct access to editorial content from Yahoo Sports. After choosing your favorite teams at launch, the app will instantly create a personalized playlist of top highlights from your teams and the top stories across sports.
* “You’ll also get the great coverage and in-depth analysis you’ve come to expect from the Yahoo Sports editorial team such as The Vertical with Woj, Instant Reactions, Sports Dash and Power Rankings,” said Yahoo.
* In addition to highlights, news and analysis, Yahoo Sports for Apple TV delivers live-streamed content to your big screen TV, including the MLB Free Game of the Day.
