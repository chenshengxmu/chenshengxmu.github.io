* Folks anxious for Apple to release OS X Mavericks to the public will be happy to hear that the final beta version of the next generation OS was sent out to Mac developers this evening.
* Apple labeled the release ‘GM,’ also known as Golden Master, which essentially means that this is the same build that users will see. It also usually means that a launch isn’t too far behind…

* As usual, registered Mac developers can grab the latest version of Mavericks either via the Software Update tool in the Mac App Store, or as a full download via Apple’s Mac Dev Center.
* While Mavericks didn’t get the design overhaul that iOS 7 did, it did get a number of new features including a tabbed Finder, Safari improvements, and desktop Maps and iBooks apps.
* Apple is expected to release OS X Mavericks later this month—possibly alongside new MacBooks and iPads. It all depends on how Apple wants to space out the announcements.
