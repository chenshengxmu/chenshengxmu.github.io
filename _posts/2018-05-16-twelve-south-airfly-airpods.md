* Premium accessory maker Twelve South yesterday unveiled a new AirFly adapter that permits AirPods owners to use their earphones with in-flight entertainment systems.
* AirFly was designed for AirPods, but works with any wireless headphones or earbuds.
* What this tiny dongle does is pair your AirPods or other wireless headphones to an in-flight entertainment system. You simply plug it into the headphone jack, then pair your wireless headphones to your AirFly via Bluetooth. Just like that, you can watch in-flight movies or catch up on current events at the gym without being tethered by cords.

* To keep you entertained even on long-haul flights, this Bluetooth transmitter features a built-in battery that lasts up to eight hours on a single charge and recharges via the included USB cord.
* “For those planes with the headphone jack next to the USB in the seatback, you can plug both the audio and the charging cables in at the same time to ensure you’re ready to go when you board the next leg of your journey,” Twelve South notes.

* Even if you don’t travel by plane very often or don’t use AirPods, you’re wholeheartedly recommended to consider this useful accessory because, as I said before, you can use AirFly with any Bluetooth wireless headphones to make them work with wired headphone jacks.
