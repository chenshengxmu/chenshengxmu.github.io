* Still wondering why Apple would want to enter the budget tablet market with a 7.85-inch iPad? Perhaps this will help shine some light on the matter.
* ComScore, a highly regarded research firm, is out with a new report today regarding the current landscape of Android tablets. And guess which slate is leading the pack? The $199 Amazon Kindle Fire…
* In fact, Amazon’s not just leading the pack, it’s dominating it. According to ComScore, the Kindle Fire accounts for over half of the U.S. Android tablet market. 54% of it to be exact. And the closest tablet to it is Samsung’s Galaxy Tab family, at just 15.4%.
* The kicker here is that the Kindle Fire isn’t even really an Android tablet. It runs a forked version of Google’s mobile operating system with a completely different user interface. And it comes with Amazon’s App Store preinstalled, not Google’s.
* So what’s the big deal? Well it would seem that the Kindle Fire isn’t necessarily a success because it’s an Android tablet. No, it appears that consumers are buying the Fire because it’s a viable low-cost tablet option with a healthy ecosystem.
* Now, imagine what kind of success Apple could have with a smaller, cheaper iPad. It certainly looks like there’s a market for one.
* Thoughts?
