* So, you’re digging those 17 new watch faces included with the iPod nano’s new firmware update?
* If you’ve just ordered a nano, or you already have the latest hardware refresh, that means you’ll need to upgrade the firmware to receive all of the new features Apple touted at yesterday’s media event.
* In this video, we unbox a brand new iPod nano, upgrade the firmware, show off all 18 watch faces, and touch on various other new features like the enhanced Nike+ app, and new Home screen layout…
* I have to say, I really like the iPod nano. It’s perfect for running and other forms of exercise, and it works similar to the iPhone and the iPod touch.
* The new clock faces are just icing on the cake for an already solid product. I don’t see Apple getting rid of the iPod nano line any time soon. It fills its niche perfectly, and it’s fairly cheap to boot.
* Are you an iPod nano user? What do you think about the latest firmware update?
