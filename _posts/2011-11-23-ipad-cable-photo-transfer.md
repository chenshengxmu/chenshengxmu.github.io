* According to Flickr’s image upload data, a lot of people use their iPhone as their main camera. Not only is the iPhone 4 the most popular camera (not smartphone, camera) on the photo-sharing site, but Flickr’s top 4 cameraphones are iPhones.
* And the iPad, well, we all know how popular Apple’s tablet is. USBFever might actually be onto something with its new cable accessory that connects the two products, allowing users to transfer photos from the iPhone to the iPad with little effort…
* The male to male dock 30-pin dock connector cable is plug-in-play ready, meaning that the user shouldn’t have to do much more than plug the accessory into the iPad and accompanying iPhone/iPod touch. Here’s how the manufacturer describes it:
* “This is a cable made specially for transmitting Picture files from iPhone/iPod to your iPad. It is terminated with 2 dock connectors for iDevices, one to connect to iPad, one to connect to iPhone/iPad. This is a picture copy cable from iPhone/iPod to iPad, you may not use for other purpose.”
* For only $15, the accessory is the perfect companion for iPhone/iPad owners who haven’t taken to Apple’s iCloud Photo Stream feature yet. If you’re interested in it, you can find out more about the cable, and purchase it, from USBFever’s online store.
