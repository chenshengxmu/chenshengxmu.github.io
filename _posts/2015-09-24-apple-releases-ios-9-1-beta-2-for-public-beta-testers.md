* After seeding iOS 9.1 beta 2 to developers yesterday, Apple has updated its public beta portal to lend 9.1 beta 2 access to participants in its public beta program. If you’re already a member of Apple’s public beta program, and you’re currently running iOS 9.1 beta 1, you can access the update right now via an OTA software update. If you’re not a current public beta participant, you may sign up via Apple’s beta website.
* The benefit of using public beta is that you don’t have to pay the $99 annual fee to be a part of Apple’s developer program. This is great if you aren’t interested in deploying apps to the App Store, but do wish to test its latest software updates.
* Apple has a release notes link to iOS 9.1 beta 2, but the link doesn’t actually go anywhere. As such, there’s not much information as to what all the update includes, although we’ve heard that iOS 9.1 will be what ships when the iPad Pro launches later this year. The 9.1 update also supports Unicode 8, and features new emoji characters.
* Are you a part of Apple’s public beta program? Do you plan on updating to iOS 9.1 beta 2?
