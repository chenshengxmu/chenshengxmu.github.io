* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Goat Simulator. This means that for the next 7 days, you can pick up the popular sandbox title for free on both iPhone and iPad—a savings of $5.
* For those unfamiliar with the game, Goat Simulator is…exactly what it sounds like. You play as a goat, tasked with nothing more than running wild throughout a virtual town and causing as much destruction as possible.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* You’re a goat, free to run wild and cause mayhem in a virtual town. And trust us, that premise leads to tons of hilarious moments and stunts. We’ve crashed parties, head-butted cars, bounced on trampolines, and done a million other goofy things in this outrageous sandbox game.
* And here is a clip of the game in action:
* Goat Simulator is available in the App Store for free.
