* Popular is a $0.99 jailbreak tweak that replaces the recent contacts and favorite contacts shortcuts found in the App Switcher with an app launcher. Popular’s launcher differs from other tweaks of this type, because it sorts the app icons based on usage. This makes it easy to quickly locate and launch the most popular apps on your iPhone.
* Once you install Popular, you’ll need to start using apps for their usage time to be logged. Once app usage time is logged, the apps will start appearing at the top of the App Switcher ordered by usage time.

* You also have the option of assigning favorite apps that always show up first in the App Switcher in the upper left-hand corner. Apps that appear based on usage can be removed, and apps can even be blacklisted from the App Switcher if you don’t wish for them to appear there at all.
* Popular can accommodate up to 75 usage-based app icons at any given time, and statistics are logged for each individual app. You can view a numerical reading of app usage time via the Statistics portion of the tweak’s preferences.

* If you’re looking to keep tabs on your app usage, and at the same time benefit from a usage-arranged app launcher, then I recommend that you try out Popular. You can download it from Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $0.99. Share your thoughts and opinions on Popular in the comment section.
