* Apple on Monday announced an upcoming promotion for Chinese New Year. The one-day sale, spotted by MacRumors on Apple’s Hong Kong website, provides free Beats Solo3 wireless headphones with the purchase of select Mac or iPhone models.
* The promo begins on January 6 at 8:00 a.m. in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. The free Solo3 headphones will come in the red colorway, as red is believed to symbolize good fortune and joy, and is found everywhere during Chinese New Year.
* The Beats Solo3 headphones made our 2016 Holiday Gift Guide as one of our favorite pairs of Bluetooth headphones. Introduced by Apple last year, they feature the custom W1 chip for easy pairing with Apple devices and class-leading 40+ hour battery life.
* In addition to the free headphone promotion, Apple has also posted a New Year gift guide on its website that features the iPhone 7, the iPad Pro, the Apple Pencil, and of course plenty of red accessories such as iPhone cases, Apple Watch bands, and more.
