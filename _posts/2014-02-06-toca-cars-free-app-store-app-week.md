* I hope you have downloaded the excellent Spark Camera which was made temporarily free thanks to Apple’s ongoing Free App of the Week promotion. Every Thursday a new paid app picked by Apple’s editors goes free for a limited time in the App Store as Apple’s way of thanking fans for their loyalty.
* As Spark Camera today returns to its original $1.99 price, a new app has gone free until next Thursday, Toca Cars. Originally released last September and normally costing $2.99, this charming kids driving game from Toca Boca (a studio that makes digital toys for kids) has a 4.5-star rating and was never free, until today.
* I wholeheartedly recommend you grab Toca Cars in the App Store now…
* From the blurb:
* No rules apply to these roads in this super fun educational app for kids. Cruise through big puddles of ice cream, fly off jumps into a lake or build a huge pile of houses, stop lights, and mailboxes and drive right through. Ready, set, GO!
* Isn’t it cool that the game world is all recycled cardboard?

* This includes the little things such as the little dog that may chase you. Cardboard styling may be due to legal reasons: there’s no danger or ill intent in bumping a cardboard tree or knocking over the cardboard stop sign, I guess.

* As a bonus, there’s an in-game editor where kids between 3-9 years can create their own tracks, races, jumps, trees, houses, animals and what not.
* Check out the trailer.
* Best of all, Toca Cars has no third-party advertising or in-app purchases.
* Download Toca Cars free from the App Store until next Thursday.
* The 39MB download is universal and requires iOS 5.0 or later.
