* The nation’s second-largest wireless carrier, AT&T, is planning on introducing a new prepaid brand called ‘All In One’ in June, according to FierceWireless.
* The new prepaid tiers should appeal to folks who hate long-term contracts and are expected to start at $35 for feature phones and go all the way up to $50 a month for smartphones.
* Likewise, the carrier could also introduce a $70 a month tier for those whose data needs exceed two gigabytes per month, according to the report. Go past the fold for the full breakdown…
* FierceWireless breaks down the upcoming prepaid tiers, as follows:
* These new tiers are believed to be marketed as a new brand separate of AT&T’s existing GoPhone prepaid wireless offering. GoPhone is also pricier, with $65 a month for unlimited texting and calling, but with just one gigabyte of monthly data included.
* The rumored $35/$50/$75 tiers also undercut T-Mobile’s  $65 a month tier for unlimited texting, calling and two and a half gigabytes of data.
* The report goes on to note that AT&T will throttle speeds to user who use up their allotted data for the month. It’s unclear whether the new offering will include hotspot functionality. AT&T will reportedly test the new tiers in Florida and Texas later this month.
* Although the publication cautioned that details of the plans “could change before they are launched,” the new tiers should launch nationwide beginning Saturday, June 15, 2013.
* These new tiers are likely in response to Verizon, which last month launched a new $35 no-contract prepaid tier for feature phones that comes with 500 monthly minutes, unlimited texting and Internet.
* By the way, Verizon charges an extra 25 cents per minute once you spend your 500 allotted minutes.
* Sprint-owned Virgin Mobile brand also comes to mind: its $30 a month tier for the iPhone 4/4S includes 300 voice minutes and unlimited messaging/data with throttling after 2.5 gigabytes.
