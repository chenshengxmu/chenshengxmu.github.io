title: Apple Files More Lawsuits Against Samsung in Germany

* It’s been nearly a year now since Apple filed its original patent infringement suit against Samsung, and the battle is still far from over. In fact, Apple has just filed a new set of lawsuits against the Korean manufacturer.
* Bloomberg is reporting that Apple has just filed two new design-related lawsuits against Samsung in Germany’s Dusseldorf Regional Court. The suits call out several Samsung products including 10 smartphones, and 5 tablets…
* As you may recall, Apple has already won an injunction against Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet in Germany. Samsung has appealed the ban and is currently awaiting a decision from the court, which should fall in the next two weeks.
* The new lawsuits, however, go beyond Samsung’s tablets. Apple believes that 10 of Samsung’s smartphones are also infringing upon at least two of its European Union-wide design rights.
* As FOSSPatents points out, these design-related lawsuits are different than the previous technical-related ones that Apple has filed against Samsung. With technical-related suits, the end-game is fairly obvious: the infringing party either changes the product to remove the infringing components, or some type of licensing agreement is reached. But in design-related lawsuits, the end-game is not so clear. It appears that Apple won’t be satisfied until Samsung makes some drastic design changes.
* The worst part is that the actual trials for the above-mentioned lawsuits aren’t expected to take place until this Fall. Great, another year of the top two smartphone manufacturers in the world bickering.
