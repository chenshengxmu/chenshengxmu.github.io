* When Apple introduced Live Photos at its September 2015 iPhone 6s event it also announced an SDK allowing third-parties to implement support for them, while specifically saying that Live Photos would be coming to Facebook before year-end.
* Following Tumblr’s iOS app which was first to implement support for Live Photos, Facebook today started rolling out the ability to upload and view Live Photos from within their iOS app, TechCrunch reports.
* The opt-in feature works just like regular, static photos.
* When you upload a Live Photo from your Camera roll, a “LIVE” box appears in the bottom right. If you tap it, Facebook will upload the image as Live Photo. Otherwise, only the still part of the Live Photo will be uploaded, without 1.5 seconds of video and audio before and after you hit the shutter button.
* Live Photos on Facebook are viewable on any iOS device with iOS 9.0 or later, including the iPhone 4s. Live Photos show as static images in your feed by default. To animate a Live Photo, you have to tap and hold the icon in the corner which looks like a set of concentric circles which resembles the Live Photos icon in Apple’s Camera app.
* This is a staggered release so Facebook isn’t pushing support for Live Photos out to everyone at once. “While some people will see them start popping up in their feeds as early as this morning, many won’t see them until the new year,” the publication cautions.
* Just make sure not to overshare Live Photos on Facebook if they don’t add any real value to the experience.
