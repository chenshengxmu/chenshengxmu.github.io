* Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Additionally, he says the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the wearable.
* The comments were in response to a Monday report from technology research firm IDC, which estimated that Apple sold just 1.1 million Watches during its Q3, down 71% from the year-ago quarter. But Cook says its growth is off the charts.
* “Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,” Cook wrote.
* “Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,” he said.
* Apple faces mounting pressure to drum up major new sources of growth as iPhone sales continue to slow. It’s unclear just how well the Watch is doing, as Apple doesn’t disclose specific sales, but the wearables market as a whole is struggling.
