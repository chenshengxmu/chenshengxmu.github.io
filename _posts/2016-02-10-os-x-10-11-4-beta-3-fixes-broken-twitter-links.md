* An annoying issue pertaining to broken Twitter links, which has persisted in Safari for Mac since November 2015, has been fixed in the third beta of the forthcoming OS X 10.11.4 El Capitan software update, according to user reports on the Apple Support Communities forums.
* The “Safari can’t open the page because the server where this page is located is not responding” error page no longer appears when clicking shortened “t.co” Twitter links with the secure HTTPS protocol in Safari and third-party apps like Tweetbot.
* The third beta of the fourth major software update for Macs running El Capitan was seeded to registered Apple developers two days ago.
* Until OS X 10.11.4 releases for public consumption, however, users who don’t run the most recent beta can attempt to reload broken Twitter links in Safari a few times, remove “https” from the URL or use another browser to open HTTPS “t.co” links.
