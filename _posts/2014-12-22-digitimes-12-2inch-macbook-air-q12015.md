* Apple’s rumored ultra-thin MacBook Air model with a 12.2-inch screen is reportedly entering mass production in the first quarter of 2015, Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes reported Monday citing sources from the upstream supply chain.
* The Wall Street Journal said in October that production of the ultra-slim notebook with “a higher resolution” screen would commence in December of this year. DigiTimes also added that the Apple Watch is on track for a Spring 2015 release.
* Apple’s suppliers are said to have “accelerated” their supplies of related components for both the 12.2-inch MacBook Air and the Apple Watch, claims DigiTimes.
* The publication has learned that the forthcoming notebook runs Intel’s latest Broadwell processor and features a new chassis design to reduce its overall thickness and weight, which is in line with the previous rumors.
* Although start of mass production has been delayed due to low yield rates, sources are claiming that the yield issue has been gradually resolved, meaning mass production is expected to “come in the first quarter of 2015.”
* Apple’s contract fabricator Quanta Computer is reportedly going to assemble the machine which is thought to mainly cater to the high-end market segment and will therefore “only have limited shipments” art launch.

* As for the Apple Watch, DigiTimes said component makers are now shipping parts to Apple as mass production of the wearable device is believed to start in three months, conceivably in time for the Spring 2015 launch Apple’s retail boss Angela Ahrendts mentioned in a memo to employees.
* Although the Taiwanese trade publication is not the most accurate of sources, its predictions concerning Apple’s supply chain often prove (mostly) accurate so keep that in mind while deciphering this rumor.
* With the introduction of the 27-inch iMac with the “5K” Retina display two months ago, it is now clear that Apple is in the process of transitioning its whole Mac lineup to Retina screens so a Retina MacBook Air should be a no-brainer.
