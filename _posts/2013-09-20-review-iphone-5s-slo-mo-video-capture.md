* Slo-Mo video capture is what all of the cool kids are doing these days, and if you happen to own a shiny new iPhone 5s, you can now join the fun.
* The slow motion effect is the result of video that’s captured at a very high frame rate, and then slowed down. This allows you to have video with reduced speed without any herky-jerkyness. The end result is a professional quality slow motion effect that you and your friends will love.
* Slo-Mo mode captures video at a brisk 120 fps, so when you watch the video as you record through the view finder, everything seems really fast and a bit jerky. Once you finish shooting, you can use a scrubber that’s not unlike the editing scrubber used for cutting video. The scrubber allows you to adjust the in and out points for the slow motion effect.
* The final result was really impressive. Watch the video above of me throwing a couple of ducks around and you’ll see what I mean. Obviously, those who are active, play sports, and engage in other outdoor activities regularly will be the primary beneficiaries of the new tech.
* Apple has made it dumb-simple to use Slo-Mo mode, and I have a feeling that it’s going to be a huge hit among the masses. Just prepare yourself mentally for the inevitable deluge of slow motion cat videos that’s soon to follow.
* While it’s not an outright selling point for the iPhone 5s, it does help validate the upgrade over the outgoing iPhone 5. It, along with the new Touch ID fingerprint sensor, camera quality, and overall speed enhancements makes it worthy of consideration.
