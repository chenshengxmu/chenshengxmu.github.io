* Credible sources have said that Apple is planning to unveil the next iPhone at a media event scheduled for Wednesday, September 7, with pre-orders beginning on Friday, September 9 ahead of retail availability on the following Friday, September 16. An internal document from AT&T leaked by 9to5Mac, however, now suggests that the handset may actually land on store shelves on Friday, September 23.
* AT&T’s retail schedule for upcoming merchandising reset hours specifically mentions September 9 and September 23 as dates for merchandising resets. Though the document does not specifically mention the iPhone 7, the dates strongly suggest iPhone 7 pre-orders beginning September 9 and retail availability on September 23.

* September 23 retail availability is a week later than previously expected, but in line with past iPhone launches. Apple typically likes to collect pre-orders for iPhones for two weeks before their retail availability.
* As an example, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were introduced on Wednesday, September 9, 2015. Apple started taking pre-orders for the devices on Saturday, September 12, ahead of their retail availability on Friday, September 25.
* The iPhone 6, on the other hand, which had a 7-day pre-order period, can be considered the exception that proves the rule.
* When do you think the iPhone 7 will arrive in retail stores? And is Apple going to be collecting pre-orders with a 7 or 14-day window? Share your observations in comments.
