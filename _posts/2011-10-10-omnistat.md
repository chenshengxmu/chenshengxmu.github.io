* Want to know the name of your iDevice? How about its storage capacity, OS, build, or free memory available?
* For stat junkies, there’s no better jailbreak tweak than OmniStat. OmniStat is a widget that resides in iOS 5’s Notification Center, and it puts a ridiculous amount of iDevice stats right at your fingertips…
* Upon installing OmniStat beta, all you need to do is venture into your Settings app, tap Notifications, and enable the widget.
* Once enabled, it’ll display all of your favorite statistical information in your Notification Center.
* Not only is it a powerful tool, it’s also beautifully designed, complementing the linen background with style and grace.
* You can try OmniStat right now if you have a jailbroken iDevice running iOS 5. You can score it on Cydia’s BigBoss beta repo here: http://thebigboss.org/ios5beta/
* What do you think about OmniStat?
