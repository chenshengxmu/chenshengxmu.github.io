* This roundup will encompass all the jailbreak tweaks that have been launched in Cydia from August 13th until August 19th. As usual, we’ll begin by talking about our favorites, and then we’ll wrap things up with an outline of the rest afterward.

* No one likes the inconvenience of entering their passcode or authenticating with Face ID/Touch ID when they don’t have to, and that’s where a jailbreak tweak called IntelligentPass comes in handy.
