* Some App Store apps and iTunes services sometimes require a subscription to unlock more features. The iDB app for example, offers subscriptions to a monthly or annual plan via an in app-purchase. At about $10 per month, Apple Music is the perfect example of an iTunes subscription service that offers considerably more for a monthly fee.
* With more and more apps and services offering a subscription, it sometimes becomes hard to keep track of all of them, and you might end up paying for things you don’t use or need anymore. That’s why it’s a good idea to keep tab on your active subscriptions and make sure you aren’t wasting money.
* In this post, we will show you how to view the status of your App Store and iTunes subscriptions on either your iPhone or directly from iTunes on your computer.
* 1) On your iPhone or iPad, launch the Settings app.
* 2) Scroll down to the iTunes & App Store section, tap on it.
* 3) Tap on your Apple ID at the top.
* 4) Tap on View Apple ID, and enter your password or submit your Touch ID fingerprint if needed.
* 5) Scroll down and tap on the Subscriptions tab.
* You now have a list of your active and expired App Store and iTunes subscriptions.
* 1) Open iTunes on your computer.
* 2) In the Menu Bar, go to Account > View My Account…, then enter your password to authenticate.
* 3) Scroll towards the bottom and look for the Subscriptions section, under Settings. This will show you how many subscriptions you have.
* 4) Tap on the Manage link next to the Subscriptions label.
* You are now presented with your list of active and expired subscriptions.
* For active iTunes subscriptions, you will see the length of it, and when it will renew next.
* For expired iTunes subscriptions, you will see the date when it expired.
* Now that you know how to find out what apps or services you may be subscribed to, it might be a good idea to check it for yourself and make sure you’re not paying for something you don’t use. If you are, have a look at our tutorial on how to cancel App Store app subscriptions.
* If you’d like to support iDB, consider downloading the iPhone app and subscribing to a monthly or annual plan. Thank you!
