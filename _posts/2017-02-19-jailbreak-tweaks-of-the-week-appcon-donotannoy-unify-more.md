* The iOS 10 jailbreak is nothing short of a hot commodity since it became stable enough to use, and jailbreak developers are taking advantage of it, left and right, to release smashing new jailbreak tweaks that let you change the way your jailbroken iPhone or iPad works.
* In this roundup, we’ll show you all of the jailbreak tweaks that were released this week, starting with our favorites and then wrapping up with the rest of them afterwards.
* Aerial – $1.99
* Aerial is a really cool new jailbreak tweak that lets you colorize each and every one of your Status Bar icons.
* You can choose what you want the color of each one to be, and all settings you make take effect on the fly. These effects are visible across all and any of your apps on your iPhone or iPad and help to make the icons pop against the monotonous background colors.
* You can read our full review of Aerial to learn more about customizing it.
* AppCon – $1.99

* AppCon is a super slick jailbreak tweak that lets you change the app icons of your apps on your Home screen with images from your device’s Photo Library.
* You get two main functionalities with this tweak, including the ability to change individual app icons, and the ability to set an entire grid of app icons as a single image.
* To learn more about how the tweak works and its two different modes, you can read our full review.
* DoNotAnnoy – $1.99

* We all have that one friend who is just so unable to spell out sentences or paragraphs, and rather sends a message for every two or three words instead.
* This leads to an onslaught of annoying notifications, and that’s where a new jailbreak tweak called DoNotAnnoy comes in to help.
* It works differently than Do Not Disturb by allowing you to silence your device’s ‘buzzing’ and notifications for pre-set intervals. This way, you only receive one notification from the annoying contact once every so often rather than for each and every message.
* It’s a good solution for those with annoying friends to text like this, and to learn more about how it works, you can read our full review.
* MakeRespringsGreatAgain  – FREE

* Ever since the iOS 10 jailbreak was released, the respring screen has lacked the iconic Apple boot logo.
* MakeRespringsGreatAgain simply brings back the classic Apple logo respring screen on your jailbroken iOS 10 device.
* You can read our full review to understand more about the tweak and how it works.
* Unify – $0.99

* Unify is an incredible jailbreak tweak for iOS 10 that helps to better organize your Lock screen notifications.
* Normally, your notifications can clutter up your Lock screen in a big unorganized mess, which is usually the case when you wake up in the morning and all of your nighttime notifications catch up with you, but Unify groups all of your notifications by app, giving you the nice clean and grouped notification UI you see above.
* With tons of options to configure and functionality that actually improves iOS, Unify is definitely worth trying out. You can read our full review to learn more about it.
