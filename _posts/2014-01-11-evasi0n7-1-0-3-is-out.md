* Evasi0n 7 1.0.3 has just been released for OS X and Windows with a fix for the boot loop issue that has been plaguing Retina iPad mini users. The release, which is the fourth of the jailbreak tool, also includes support for iOS 7.1 beta 3 and a new Cydia bundle.
* Those already successfully running evasion7 1.0.2 on their devices do not have to update, but those having problems with their Retina iPad mini (I believe cellular models are the problem) or those wanting to update to iOS 7 beta 3 may want to check it out…
* Although I’ve not personally experienced the reboot loop issue in jailbreaking my Retina iPad mini, I have seen it mentioned quite a bit on Twitter, and it seems to be popular topic on the JailbreakQA website. So it’s obviously nice to have this problem resolved.
* You can download evasi0n7 1.0.3 directly from our downloads page, and if you need any help, we have great tutorials on how to use the program for both Mac and Windows computers. Be sure to share your experience and/or questions in the comments below!
