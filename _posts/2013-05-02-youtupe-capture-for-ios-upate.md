* It looks like it’s ‘release your updates’ day today for iOS developers. Earlier this morning we saw software updates seeded by Apple and Instagram, and now we have one from Google for its popular YouTube Capture app.
* Today’s update brings the app to version 1.3, and it includes a handful of new features and improvements. For starters, it features a new ‘only upload on Wi-Fi’ option, and there’s also HD and speed enhancements on board…
* Here’s the full 1.3 change log:
* YouTube Capture is the easiest way to upload videos to YouTube. Version 1.3 introduces high-definition enhancement previews, Wi-Fi only uploads, and general app improvements.
* What’s New: -HD preview of enhancements -“Only upload on Wi-Fi” option -Upload shows time remaining -Faster launch speed
* Things We Fixed: -Misbehaving when low on storage space -Misbehaving while uploading
* I don’t use YouTube Capture enough to notice if there really is any difference in its launch speed, but the other changes mentioned above are pretty handy. I particularly like the new ‘Only upload on Wi-Fi’ option, and I imagine it will save some folks from overage fees.
* If you don’t already use the app, there’s nothing here that will necessarily make you want to try out this new version. But for those that already have it, the update’s a no-brainer. You can find YouTube Capture in the App Store, for free.
