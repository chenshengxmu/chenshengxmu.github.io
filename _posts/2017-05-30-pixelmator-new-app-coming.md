* Pixelmator, the makers of perhaps the best Photoshop alternative for macOS, teased a brand new app in a blog post today that they’ve been secretly working on for five whole years.
* The mystery app is coming soon, said the Pixelmator team.
* While they stopped short of revealing what the forthcoming software is about, it’s a safe bet that they’ve been working on a new kind of image-editing app for Mac. All we know that it’s the coolest thing that “we or anyone else has done in years” and their biggest project ever.
* The Pixelmator team said:
* This is the biggest thing that we’ve ever done. The most innovative, beautiful and powerful thing that we’ve ever done. And it’s also the most Mac thing that we’ve ever done.
* The teaser image they shared shows a little bit of the app’s interface, suggesting it could be an app for vector graphics akin to Adobe Illustrator.
* To get notified when the new app launches, subscribe to Pixelmator’s Notify Me list. The app is “wildly innovative, stunningly beautiful, incredibly powerful and very Mac,” reads the website.
