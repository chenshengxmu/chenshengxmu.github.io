* Siri competitor Alexa has come to the world’s most popular smartphone via an incoming update for Amazon’s shopping app for iPhone and iPad. The release marks the first time Amazon’s personal assistant has supported non-Alexa hardware.
* Just tap the mic in the app’s search bar to ask Alexa questions, get weather updates, shop and search items, order and track products, play music, use Alexa Skills and Smart Home features, and much more.
* By sneaking Alexa into its iPhone app, Amazon’s made it possible for Apple customers to experience its Siri rival in full glory without needing to buy an Echo speaker.
* Alexa in the Amazon app can be asked to reorder items, track packages, search Amazon.com, buy products on your behalf and more. You can even use your voice to get news, weather and traffic information, open Kindle books, play songs from Amazon Music Unlimited and Prime Music or those you’ve purchased and more.
* The app includes an overhauled media player for books and music.
* Crucially, Alexa in the Amazon app supports Alexa Skills and Smart Home features.
* Configurable through the companion Alexa app or at alexa.amazon.com, Alexa Skills are voice-driven capabilities that enhance the functionality of Alexa-enabled devices.
* You can use more than 10,000 skills in the iPhone app.
* VentureBeat says most Alexa-compatible devices for the connected home are configurable via the app, but the Door Lock API for unlocking smart door locks won’t be supported at launch.
* POLL: do you own any HomeKit products?
* Other than that, you can control a wide range of Alexa smart home products with Amazon’s updated iPhone app. According to the company, tens of thousands of developers are building skills for Alexa.
* Yesterday, Amazon made it free for developers to build and host most skills using Amazon Web Services. Under the new program, app makers are offered AWS promotional credits to put toward their Alexa skill.
