* Apple on Friday confirmed that it will not be live-streaming its education-focused event on Tuesday, March 27. The company has updated the Events app on Apple TV to show information about the presentation, but notes that a video of the event will not be available until after it concludes.
* This is an interesting development, as Apple has offered live broadcasts of its media events in recent years. It’s very likely the company decided that since this is an education-focused affair, with announcements geared specifically at students and teachers, a live stream wasn’t necessary.
* The event is set to kick off at 11am next Tuesday at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois. While we’re not quite sure what to expect, there have been plenty of rumors regarding new, lower-cost iPad and MacBook models, as well as new classroom-specific software.
* As usual, we here at iDB will be covering the event and all subsequent announcements live, and we hope you’ll join us!
* Thanks Anders!
