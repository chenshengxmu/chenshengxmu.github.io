* Apple SVP Eddy Cue is on stage now at Apple’s event to announce the new 4K Apple TV. In addition to the hardware, Cue made a couple of major ( and frankly, surprising) announcements regarding 4K content in iTunes.
* Apparently, when iTunes rolls out its 4K content, it will be priced the same as high definition content. So no need to worry about that big price gap between 4K and HD that you’ve seen in physical media. Also, folks wondering what happens to all of their previous HD purchases will be happy to hear that Apple will upgrade them to 4K versions (where available) for free.
* Here’s more on the move from Eddy Cue:
* “Bring the magic of the cinema straight to your living room with the new Apple TV 4K,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “Customers will love watching stunning 4K HDR movies from an impressive catalog on iTunes, while also getting automatic upgrades of 4K HDR movies already in their iTunes library and enjoying 4K content on services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, coming soon.”
* These are nice surprises indeed, given that folks were expecting to pay more for new and upgraded 4K content, and should help push Apple TV 4K sales.
