* Apple’s Battery Health feature has exited beta.
* Aside from a bunch of bug fixes and several feature changes, yesterday’s release of iOS 12 beta 5 came without beta designation for the Battery Health section in Settings → Battery.
* In other words, Apple appears confident that it’s worked out the kinks and thinks Battery Health is now truly ready for prime time following its debut four months ago.
* TUTORIAL: How to assess iPhone battery health and manage throttling
* Battery Health is Apple’s answer to the iPhone throttling controversy. With iOS 11.3 or later, customers can assess battery health of their iPhone and view its current performance capacity.

* Worn-out batteries the operate below 80% performance capacity are likely to trigger a built-in performance-reduction feature. With Battery Health, customers can disable this performance management at any time, but at the risk of unexpected shutdowns.
* While performance smoothing is off by default, it gets turned on if your iPhone starts experiencing unexpected shutdowns because of an excessive draw on a worn-out battery.
* Battery Health first released alongside iOS 11.3 on March 29.
