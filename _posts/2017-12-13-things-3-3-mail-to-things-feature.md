* German developer Cultured Code yesterday announced a new Mail to Things feature in its to-do app for iPhone, iPad and Mac, called Things.
* Mail to Things opens your Things inbox up to all sorts of previously impossible workflows.
* This is a powerful new way to create to-dos in Things from other apps, services and platforms. You just send an email to Things Cloud and it instantly appears as a to-do in the Things app.
* To try it out, open Things Cloud’s settings and enable the Mail to Things feature, then send an email to your new @things.email address.
* The email’s subject becomes your to-do’s title and the rest goes into the notes.

* Thanks to the ubiquity of email, there are literally hundreds of ways to use this feature.
* Typical examples range from sending to-dos to Things from other platforms (like Outlook on your PC at work or the Mail app on your Mac), forwarding an email to Things from your iPhone (the app will link back to the email so you can find it again later) or giving your @things.email address to a trusted partner or colleague so they can delegate to-dos to you.
* Things has other features at your disposal to help you bring all your to-dos into one place—Quick Entry, Siri, 3D Touch and the Add to Things extension—but Mail to Things brings that functionality outside of the Apple ecosystem.
* Culture Code’s support document provides more examples of what’s possible with the feature.

* Today’s updates are available across Things apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac and the web.
* Don’t forget that Things integrates with popular apps, such as Workflow, IFTTT and Zapier, making it a cinch to build powerful workflows which create to-dos for you automatically. Keep in mind that you cannot your @things.email address does not support file attachments and limits long emails to 2,000 characters.
* This update is available free to existing users of the app.
* Things 3 is a $9.99 download from App Store.
* This 3 for macOS is $49.99 on Mac App Store.
