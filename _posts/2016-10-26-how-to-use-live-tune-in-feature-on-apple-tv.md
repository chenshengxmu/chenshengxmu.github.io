* The fourth-generation Apple TV allows you to begin watching a live channel immediately, simply by asking Siri. Called Live Tune-In, this feature works with supported video-streaming apps that provide live TV functionality.
* With it, you can quickly pop into a live news broadcast on CNN or a live game on ESPN without manually launching apps or navigating menus.
* In other words, Live Tune-In makes your Apple TV behave more like a conventional TV. Telling Siri to go to a live channel couldn’t be easier, as this quick tutorial attests.
* Live Tune-In requires the following:
* In order to use Live Tune-In with a compatible live-streaming app, you must already be subscribed to the service in question. As you can see on the screenshot below, tvOS 9.2’s “What’s New” splash screen promoted Live Tune-In.
* tvOS 9.2 was released in March 2016.

* Live Tune-In is available in the United States only.
* Readers who don’t live in U.S. may be able to use Live Tune-In if they’re logged in to the tvOS App Store with a U.S. account and set regional settings on their Apple TV to “United States” and Siri settings to “English (United States”).
* A tvOS app that offers 24/7 streams based on HTTP Live Streaming and FairPlay Streaming—regardless of whether they’re available for free to all users or with paid subscriptions—can optionally offer Live Tune-In functionality.
* Assuming a developer has implemented support for Live Tune-In in their app, a user can invoke Siri and simply say aloud what channel they’d like to watch live.
* This is how you can jump straight into the live TV feeds of select apps.
* 1) Press and hold the Siri button on your Siri Remote or tap the Siri icon in the Apple TV Remote app on your iOS device, then say: “Watch [APP NAME] live”.
* 2) Let go of the button.
* For example, if you have CBS app on your device you would simply say “Watch CBS live” to start watching their live TV programming, as shown below.

* Or maybe you installed ESPN’s Apple TV app and wanted to jump straight to their live feed? In that case, you’d tell Siri that you wanted to “Watch ESPN live”.
* To confirm that the video currently being watched is a live broadcast, swipe down on the Siri Remote’s Touch surface to reveal a menu at the top, then highlight the Info option.

* You should see “Live” in the menu if the video is a live broadcast.
* As mentioned, video-streaming apps that contain live feeds don’t automatically gain Live Tune-In functionality: developers must specifically implement the feature.
* At the time of this writing, the following apps supported Live Tune-In:
* Apple maintains a regularly refreshed list of Live Tune-In-compatible apps for the fourth-generation Apple TV in a support document on its website.
* Keep in mind that in most cases live-streaming of premium video content requires signing in with your cable or satellite credentials, with the exception of services that offer online-only subscriptions, such as HBO NOW.
* Signing into multiple apps or authenticating by typing an alphanumeric code into a browser will soon become a thing of the past thanks to another Apple TV feature.
* They’re calling it Single Sign-On and it’s coming later this year.

* With it, you’ll manage access credentials for video-streaming apps in one central location to have tvOS automatically sign you into apps that support Single Sign-On.
* The interface will display a list of Single Sign-On apps based on your saved credentials and the tvOS App Store will promote and highlight them as well. Single Sign-On will be coming to the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch in a future update, Apple has confirmed.
* Have you used Live Tune-In yet?
* If so, what did you think of it? I use it with CNN Go and CBS All Access on a daily basis and boy does a simple option like this make a difference: with Live Tune-In, the Apple TV feels more like a conventional TV more than it ever has in the past.
* I’m also looking forward to Single Sign-On because typing my credentials into apps like HBO NOW and Netflix over and over again really annoys me.
