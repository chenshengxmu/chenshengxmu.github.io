title: Predictions For Tomorrow's Apple Event
---
* I‚Äôm glad Apple will finally unveil its new iSlate, iTab, iPad, or whatever it will be called tomorrow because I cannot stand all these ‚Äúrumors‚Äù and ‚Äúleaks‚Äù anymore.
* Within the last few weeks every Apple-related blog has been leaking some rumors that are mostly unfounded and that only serve one goal: generating traffic to their sites. I don‚Äôt know if you noticed, but I didn‚Äôt post such article once because I don‚Äôt want to drag my lovely readers (that‚Äôs you) into these pointless conversations.
* These websites spreading the rumors or leaks seldom make predictions though. They don‚Äôt, because predictions are your own opinions and they can be held accountable for them in case they are wrong.
* I like to make predictions. Unlike most major iPhone blogs out there, I don‚Äôt have an editor watching over my shoulder and I can say whatever I want. If I am wrong, well, I‚Äôm wrong. The world doesn‚Äôt stop! If I‚Äôm right though (which I usually am), then no big deal either; I‚Äôll just be in your face saying ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù üòâ
* I made 10 predictions for the iPhone in 2010 at the beginning of the month and I stand behind these. Today, I‚Äôd like to make 5 predictions for tomorrow‚Äôs Apple event.
* First things first. The name of this tablet. The rumors call it the iSlate. I really think iSlate is a terrible name. It just doesn‚Äôt sound right. To me it sounds like some torture instrument used by Iraqi insurgents. I have no idea what it could be called but my prediction is that it will not be called the iSlate. Apple has much more class than that.
* Everyone is excited about OS 4.0. See, the iPhone OS and the tablet OS are pretty much the same so releasing OS 4.0 for the tablet tomorrow would mean releasing OS 4.0 for the iPhone too. Then what would Apple have to unveil for the iPhone in June? Just new hardware? No! I predict that the tablet will run OS 3.2. OS 4.0 will not be available until June or July of this year, when Apple announces the new iPhone.
* Don‚Äôt expect to get yourself a tablet anytime for the next few months. While many people think the tablet will be available for sale right away, I predict it won‚Äôt be available for a few months. If I had to give a date, I would say April 2010.
* I‚Äôm really not sure about this one but I think Apple will go with Verizon. My heart tells me Apple will choose Verizon, but my head tells me they want to stick with AT&T. Which one should I listen to? Ok, I have to make a decision, I say Verizon!
* There has been many rumors saying that AT&T will lose the iPhone exclusivity tomorrow. I don‚Äôt think so. I believe this event is about the tablet, not the iPhone. Even if Apple chooses Verizon for the tablet, it doesn‚Äôt mean it will drop AT&T for the iPhone. I believe that after tomorrow, AT&T will remain the exclusive iPhone carrier in the US.
* Enough with that I think. Now I want to hear what YOU think. If you think I‚Äôm wrong, please explain why. If you have more predictions to make, please feel free to share with us by leaving a comment below.
