* Rejoice, Apple has brought Multitasking to all apps in iOS7. The new multitasking features included new intelligent scheduling, opportunistic updates, adaption to network conditions, coalesced updates, and push triggers.
* The new multitasking includes a completely redesigned app switcher with full screen app previews, which will make it much easier to identify running apps. Needless to say, it’s a pretty radical change from the current concept of multitasking in iOS…
* Multitasking has always been a smart way to switch between apps. Now it’s even smarter. Because iOS 7 learns when you like to use your apps and can update your content before you launch them. So if you tend to check your favorite social app at 9:00 a.m. every day, your feed will be ready and waiting for you. That’s multitasking in iOS 7. It knows what you want to do before you do.

* Intelligent update scheduling for apps makes it so that the apps you use the most pull in updates most often, and your most-used apps gain priority when it comes to background sharing.
* Using the new multitasking is a very familiar exercise. A double press of the home button invokes the multitasking interface, and a double tap of the application zooms into the app you wish to view. Multitasking looks great, and it’s a huge departure from the run of the mill multitasking interface, yet it still works close enough to current multitasking that it’ll be easy to use.
