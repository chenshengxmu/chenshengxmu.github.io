title: Poll- what's more important to you - screen size or battery life?

* Pundits and fans are in agreement that a bigger screen will be the #1 selling point of Apple’s forthcoming iPhone 6 refresh. With two models in tow, one with a 4.7-inch screen and the other using a phablet-class 5.5-inch display, the iconic smartphone will for the first time go comfortably past four inches.
* So, who’s willing to trade a bigger screen for a much-improved battery that could keep you going for 24 hours or more, on a single charge? For the sake of completeness, One survey identified a longer-lasting battery as the top feature request by early iPhone 5 adopters ahead of the handset’s September 2012 launch…
* This notion is driven home rather effectively by Samsung’s new Galaxy S5 commercial which likens iPhone users to wall huggers. The 60-second spot argues that the Apple handset has a sub-par battery which tethers folks to the wall and therefore deprives them of the life’s precious moments.
* But first, the poll – cast your vote below.
* Just a few quick observations.
* Although a bigger screen needs a larger enclosure that in turn can house a bigger, longer-lasting battery, a larger form-factor does not necessarily guarantee energy advances.
* For starters, phablets are usually outfitted with faster processors with additional cores needed to power apps and graphics on a larger canvas. The problem is, as powerful as these chips can be, most of them are power hogs – that’s why playing resource-intensive games drains your iPhone’s battery fast.
* More importantly, a bigger screen needs a larger total backlight which in turn puts a strain on the battery.
* Now, most rumors point to Apple’s A8 processor being still dual-core and apparently focused on better power efficiency.

* Of course, you could have both – a bigger screen and a longer-lasting battery – usually if a device is chubbier.
* That won’t be the case with the iPhone 6 – the handset is said to be between 6 and 7mm thick, leading some Chinese sources to speculate that Apple’s obsession with thinness will yield only marginal battery improvements.
* As in, a 2,500mAh battery – more powerful than the 1,570mAh package inside the iPhone 5s/5c, but paling in comparison with high-end Android handsets that sport a 3,000mAh or stronger batteries.
* At any rate, yours truly is willing to bet that a stronger battery in the iPhone 6 will offset the increases in power requirements stemming from the phone’s bigger screen and increased pixel count.

* A noted analyst claimed in a note this morning that a 5.5-inch iPhone 6 will be delayed until 2015 due to production woes.
* The report matches up with stories earlier by Taiwanese media which asserted that Apple’s battery cell suppliers like LG Chemical and Samsung couldn’t produce iPhone 6 battery components measuring 2mm or less, as per Apple’s spec sheet.
* Before signing off, a sketchy report by British tabloid The Daily Mail calls for a secret partnership between Apple and a UK-based firm called Intelligent Energy. Specifically, Apple is ostensibly looking to use Intelligent Energy’s  fuel cell technology to permit future iPhones and iPads to run on a single charge for days, or even weeks.
* I’m interested to hear your take on the Bigger Screen vs. Stronger Battery dilemma. Which one would you be willing to trade for the other, and why?
