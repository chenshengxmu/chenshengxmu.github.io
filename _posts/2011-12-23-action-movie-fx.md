* Applications can turn a smartphone into a swiss army knife, enabling it to do a number of things outside of its native scope of abilities.
* Action Movie FX is a perfect example of that. The recently-released app turns your iPhone into a bonafide action movie-maker, allowing you to add high-quality digital effects to your videos like explosions and car crashes…
* Action Movie FX is the first iOS app from Bad Robot Interactive. The company is responsible for some of the year’s biggest box office hits, including Super 8 and Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol.
* Now you too can create blockbuster action movies with Action Movie FX. The app itself is free, and comes with two special effects: Missile Attack and Car Smash. Other effects are available as in-app purchases for $0.99.
* As you can see in the video, the app doesn’t just create realistic visuals, but also top-notch sound effects. And after creating an action scene, users can share the clip via Facebook or Email, or choose to save the video to the Camera Roll.
* Even if you’re not an aspiring movie-maker, Action Movie FX is quite entertaining. If you want to check it out, it’s available in the App Store for free.
