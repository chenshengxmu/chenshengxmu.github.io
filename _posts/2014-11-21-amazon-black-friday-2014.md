* Amazon joined Walmart and others in launching its Black Friday sale early today. The online retailer will be discounting a number of products over the next several days in a mix of limited-time deals, pre-Black Friday, Black Friday and Cyber Monday offerings.
* Among the discounts we’re seeing on Amazon.com right now include select Beats headphones, which are being discounted by as much as $80 depending on the model, various iOS-connected wearables, and more. We’re even seeing some Apple products on sale.
* And this is just the tip of the iceberg. For more Amazon Black Friday deals, click here.
* Admittedly, Amazon doesn’t always have as good of deals as Walmart or Best Buy, but to some [Prime members!] the convenience is probably worth the extra few dollars. Remember, when you shop online, you avoid the lines and the rest of the Black Friday madness.
* Stay tuned to iDB throughout the weekend and all next week as we continue our coverage of sales on apps and electronics.
