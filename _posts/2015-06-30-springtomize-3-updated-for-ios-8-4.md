* One of the most popular and well-regarded tweaks available on Cydia has just been updated. Springtomize 3, under the tutelage of another developer, has been updated to work with the latest Apple firmware. I’ve tested it out personally, and can confirm that it works on iOS 8.4.

* Springtomize often appears in “best of” lists because of its depth, options, and relative ease of use. You can literally make your iPhone’s Springboard look completely different courtesy of Springtomize 3. Watch our video walkthrough of the tweak in action below for more proof:
* If you’re jailbroken, which you can now do on iOS 8.4, then refresh Cydia to find Springtomize 3 1.3.0. It’s seriously one of the greatest tweaks, and I don’t think you’ll regret it.
* Are you happy that Springtomize is now available on the latest jailbreakable firmware? Drop us a note in the comments with your thoughts on the update.
