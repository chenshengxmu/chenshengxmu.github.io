* The white iPhone 4 is more fiction than fact these days. After it was shown off during the original iPhone 4 announcement, the white device has been yet to be seen again. It started off as a two-week delay. Then Apple realized how serious the problem was and the weeks turned into months.
* After several months in hiding, the white iPhone 4 might be making a come back in the near future. Although there’s still no official release date, evidence is piling up that we may soon see this mythical gadget…
* In February, we reported that Vodafone had a white iPhone 4 listed on their website as coming soon. Last week we mentioned a report that the white iPhone could ship as early as next month.
* What’s the latest white iPhone 4 gossip? MacRumors is reporting today that one of their readers was poking around in the iTunes 10.2 resource files and discovered an icon for a white CDMA iPhone 4. It’s the icon that shows up in the ‘Summary’ window in iTunes when your iPhone is connected.
* With so many rumors flying about this device, I try to take each one with a grain a salt. Not to mention with Apple’s iPhone 5 just a few months away, who really cares at this point if a white version launches?
* Now that Verizon users can chime in, would you purchase a white iPhone if it launched in April? Tell us below!
