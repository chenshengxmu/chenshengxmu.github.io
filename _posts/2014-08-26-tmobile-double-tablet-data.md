* T-Mobile, the nation’s fourth-largest wireless provider, on Tuesday announced it’s doubling LTE data when you add a tablet to your smartphone plan.
* Moreover, the firm said it’s increased the number of lines supported by its family plan accounts to ten.
* These changes arrive just as the Deutsche Telekom-owned carrier yesterday unveiled a new $5 per month option quadrupling the amount of high-speed LTE data included in the Simple Starter plan from 512 megabytes to two gigabytes.
* As the company explained in a pair of press releases here and here, doubling LTE data requires adding a tablet to your Simple Choice smartphone plan.
* Available starting September 3, add “any tablet” to your postpaid Simple Choice smartphone plan for an additional $10 per month per device and T-Mobile will match the amount of smartphone data (up to five gigabytes a month) on the tablet side.
* For instance, if you’re on a 5GB per month smartphone plan and you add a tablet for $10 per month, you’ll also get an additional five gigs of high-speed LTE data to use on that tablet.
* So, instead of being forced to share data allotments across phones and tablets, T-Mobile instead matches your smartphone data on the tablet side, effectively doubling your data allowance.
* Keep in mind that this is on top of the 200MB of free LTE data T-Mobile gives you every single month for the life of your tablet.
* Here’s an example Simple Choice Plan with 5 gigs of LTE data.

* In another development, the carrier said that customers can now add up to ten lines to Family Plans at the same rate of $10 per line per month after the second subscriber.
* Previously, Family Plans were limited to up to five lines. This change goes into effect tomorrow, Wednesday, August 27. Unlike competitors’ family plans that typically come with shared data, T-Mobile’s treat each person and device to a dedicated LTE bucket.
* “With the Un-carrier, you always know how much LTE data you have available − and you never have to limit your usage or worry about being hit with domestic overages,” said the firm.
* Lines on Simple Choice plans get unlimited talk, text and a dedicated bucket of LTE data starting at up to 1GB and each can be upgraded to Unlimited 4G LTE data for an additional $30 per line per month.
