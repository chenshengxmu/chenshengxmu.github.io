* This year, the MLB is doing things a bit different with the way its viewers can watch games on their mobile devices. Today, the new MLB At Bat 2012 app hit the App Store, available on both the iPhone and iPad, Fox News notes. In previous years, the cost was $15 for each app — which totaled $30 for a viewer who wanted the experience on both the iPhone and iPad.
* The new version of MLB At Bat is now available for free, but you can get more features with a $15 season pass…
* For $15, customers get live game day audio of all of their favorite teams, pitch tracking, and play-by-play updates. The plan also gives you the ability to watch live video for one game a day — one that the MLB selects. It is available within the app, via in-app purchase.
* However, if you’re a subscriber to the $125 MLB.TV program, you can watch any game you want. Plus with the $125 subscription, you can also watch MLB.TV on your Apple TV, through the pre-loaded app. There are some games that are blacked out in some regions, though.
* Launching later this season, the MLB will also introduce location specific apps for when you actually go see a game live. The location specific apps will provide parking information, social integration, and more.
* The MLB At Bat 2012 services kick off March 3rd when spring training begins. The app is now available on the App Store for free, with the $15 in-app purchase available. For a baseball fan, it sounds like a great deal.
* Who are you rooting for this season?
