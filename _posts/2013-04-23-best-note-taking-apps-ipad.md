* This app started out as a creativity notepad for people looking to sketch out their ideas. However, over the past couple of years, it has blossomed into a very useful note-taking app. You can sketch ideas using the selection of pens, pencils, and other artist tools, make gesture-based checklists, and annotate pictures with comments and drawings. Fonts can be customized with the swipe of a finger. You can organize your notes into different notebooks to track them down easily.

* One of the best features of this note-taking app is that it has a very natural and realistic hand-writing tool. If you are not comfortable using the iPad’s touch screen keyboard and haven’t already invested in some kind of keyboard case, you will love writing on your iPad with this. Of course, you’ll need a stylus in order to make the most out of your chicken scratch. However, Penultimate features smooth, realistic handwriting simulation with multiple paper styles and a variety of pen color options. You can search your text, save your ideas directly to Evernote, and share single page images or full PDF notebooks with others. You can import images, annotate files, and sketch ideas. This app is available for free.

* If you are in college, you kind of need this app. Not only can you handwrite notes, but you can type text as well. It includes a full-featured word processor with the ability to spell check, add bullet points, and more. You can annotate PDFs, so if your professor sends out a worksheet, you can write notes directly on the iPad without having to switch to a different app. The most useful feature of this app is that it records audio. You can record a lecture while taking notes. The app syncs what you type with what was recorded so that, when you go back over your notes, if something you wrote doesn’t make sense, you can tap a word and it will play back the section of the lecture that took place at that time. This app is available for $5.99.
