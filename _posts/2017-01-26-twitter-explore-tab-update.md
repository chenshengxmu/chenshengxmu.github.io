* Twitter on Thursday announced that it has begun rolling out an enhanced Explore tab for its mobile users. The updated feature combines trending topics, Moments, search and live video into a single spot to make it easier for users to see what’s happening on the social network.
* Over the past year, we’ve been exploring different ways to make it simpler for people to find and use trends, Moments, and search. During our research process, people told us that the new Explore tab helped them easily find news, what’s trending, and what’s popular right now. 
* Twitter reassures users that none of the popular features are going away, they’re just getting easier to find. The updated Explored tab will begin hitting iOS devices today, and Android in the “coming weeks.” Just make sure you have the latest version of the official Twitter app installed.
