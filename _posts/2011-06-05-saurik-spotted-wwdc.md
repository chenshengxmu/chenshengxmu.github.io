* Well, well, well… look who we have here. Could that be the father of jailbreaking himself, Jay “saurik” Freeman, sitting in line for Apple’s World Wide Develepors Conference?
* Yes, that is saurik. Freeman is apparently in attendance for Apple’s developer conference this week, and he’s already in line at The Moscone Center. First Peter Hajas gets hired by Apple, now this? Pretty soon we’ll see Steve Jobs talk about jailbreaking during a keynote…

* A big thanks to Matthew of The Next Web for spotting Freeman and snapping this pic.
* I’d love to see an image of saurik walking through the front door of The Moscone Center tomorrow with his famous “Reloading Data” t-shirt. What about you?
