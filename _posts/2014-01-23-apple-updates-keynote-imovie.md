* Apple is on a roll today in terms of software updates. The company has just seeded the third OS X 10.9.2 beta to its registered Mac developers and revamped Pages, Keynote and Numbers on the web (excuse me, iCloud) with a slew of new capabilities, including – finally! – password protection for your iWork documents. Earlier in the day, Apple has managed to post a minor Podcasts app refresh and a bug fix focused update to iMovie for Mac.
* And now, new versions of Pages and Numbers for iOS and OS X have arrived plus an enhanced version of Apple’s presentation software Keynote with new transitions, improved presenter display options, better Microsoft PowerPoint and iCloud compatibility and more.
* These software updates allow for a nice feature parity across Apple’s iWork suite of apps on the web, iOS and OS X platforms…
* Keynote 6.1 for Mac offers two new transitions for your presentations – Droplet and Grid – and comes with enhanced presenter display options.
* In line with today’s iWork for iCloud refinements, Keynote 6.1 now makes it easy to share password-protected presentations via iCloud link.
