* Apple hired Morgan Wandell from Amazon Studios to head its international video development, a move that has been in the works for months, Variety reported this past weekend.
* He will start at Apple’s Culver City office at the end of this month.
* As Apple’s new head of international creative development for worldwide video, Wandell will be charged with developing “big-ticket productions that can travel well around the world.”
* The executive will report to recent Sony Pictures TV presidents Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, whom Apple hired in June to build out its original programming with a budget of $1 billion in the next twelve months.
* He previously worked with Van Amburg and Erlicht on the development of “Sneaky Pete,” a busted Sony Pictures TV pilot for CBS that moved to Amazon.
* According to Wandell’s LinkedIn profile, he had been with Amazon since 2013.
* Among the other series he spearheaded at Amazon are the Emmy award-winning show “The Man in the High Castle” and the Golden Globe award-winning show “Goliath,” plus the upcoming “Jack Ryan” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”
* Before Amazon, the producer had spent several years at ABC Studios working on popular shows like “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Lost,” “Desperate Housewives,” “Private Practice,” “Criminal Minds” and “Ghost Whisperer.”
* Earlier in his career, Wandell headed development for the in-school educational network Channel One.
