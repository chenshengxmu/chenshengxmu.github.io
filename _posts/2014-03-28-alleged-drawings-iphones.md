* A fairly sketchy, schematic-like drawing has surfaced on the web this morning depicting what could be two next-gen iPhones. The image, which is of terrible quality, was first published by popular Japanese magazine MacFan and then passed on by Macotakara.
* As you can see, the drawing shows two separate handsets: one with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.7-inch display. This lines up with several previous reports, as do many of the design elements of the devices such as their bezel-free screens and slim profile…
* According to MacRumors, the two devices in the image are actually referred to as iPhone ‘6c’ models by MacFan and Macotakara. While it seems odd that Apple would offer two smartphone models with multiple display sizes, it does match up with prior intel.
* Also worth noting is that there seems to be a single-bulb circular flash next to the rear camera. Apple moved to a dual-LED flash with the iPhone 5s, but interestingly enough, we saw the same circle flash on a purported iPhone 6 dummy unit earlier this week.

* So what does all of this mean? Probably nothing. But we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention it and it turned out to be something. With manufacturers rumored to start mass-producing next-gen iPhones within the next few months, we should know more very soon.
* Yesterday, the oft-accurate Japanese news outlet Nikkei reported that the so-called iPhone 6 will come in both 4.7- and 5.5-inch variations.
