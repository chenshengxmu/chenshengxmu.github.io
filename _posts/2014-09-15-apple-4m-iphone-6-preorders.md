* Apple on Monday put out a press release confirming it took four million pre-orders of the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the first 24 hours, representing a twofold increase over the two million pre-order sales for the iPhone 5 in 2012.
* “iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are better in every way, and we are thrilled customers love them as much as we do,” the media release quotes Apple CEO Tim Cook as saying. The four million pre-orders for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 24 hours set a new record for Apple.
* Last September, the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s sold 9 million units during their opening weekend (there were no pre-orders for the iPhone 5s).
* Reiterating that demand for the new iPhones “exceeds the initial pre-order supply,” the Cupertino firm cautions that many iPhone pre-orders are now scheduled to be delivered in October even though “a significant amount” will be delivered to customers beginning on Friday “and throughout September”.
* Apple’s brick-and-mortar stores will provide additional supply of the handsets to walk-in customers on the launch day Friday, September 19 at 8:00am local time.
* Apple reminds customers to arrive early in order to claim their handset, or order one online from its Online Store for home delivery or in-store pickup.
* Last but not least, Apple says that both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will be available in store on Friday from AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, as well as from “additional carriers“ and select Apple Authorized Resellers.
