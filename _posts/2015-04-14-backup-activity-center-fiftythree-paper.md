* FiftyThree’s iPad drawing app, Paper, has been refreshed Tuesday with a pair of new features (among other enhancements) — Backup and Activity Center.
* The former lets you back up private copies of your journals in the cloud so you don’t lose your Paper data in case your iPad is stolen or damaged (and you didn’t have enough space on iCloud for full device backup via iOS).
* The Activity Center is a new place in Paper’s Mix service that collates all your social activity in one place. For those wondering, Mix is an online repository of Paper content posted by creative users from around the world.
* Keep in mind that backups are created automatically when you create a brand new FiftyThree account. Those already logged in will need to opt-in to backup manually in the latest version of Paper.
* As for the Activity Center, use it to see if you have new starred or remixed creations, check out and connect with users who’ve recently followed you and more.
* When you see a drawing you like, a single tap opens it in Mix. Tapping on a user’s avatar takes you to their creations and profile. From there, tap the plus sign to follow them.
* Keep in mind that you cannot tap an avatar unless its owner has followed you or starred your creation.
* Paper 2.4.1 changelog:
* More information about Backup and Activity Center in Paper is available in a support document found on FiftyThree’s website.
* The 75.3-megabyte app requires an iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Download Paper for free in the App Store.
