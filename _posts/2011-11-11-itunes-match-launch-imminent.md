* Apple missed its scheduled release of iTunes Match last month, but it seems that the company is now preparing for a public launch, as they sent emails to developers earlier today to warn them about a reset of all libraries.
* Apple has sent similar emails in the last few weeks, but this one has been worded slightly differently, making us believe that the company is preparing for the launch of iTunes Match…
* According to the email, all current iCloud libraries will be deleted on November 12th at 10am PST. Does that mean that iTunes Match will officially launch shortly after? While we can’t confirm, it seems reasonable to think iTunes Match is right around the corner.
