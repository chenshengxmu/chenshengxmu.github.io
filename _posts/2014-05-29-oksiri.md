* One of my favorite things about Android is the “OK Google” command that allows you to perform quick voice searches on a whim. Now iPhone users can (sort of) join in on the fun.
* OkSiri is a brand new jailbreak tweak that brings always-on voice recognition to iOS 7 devices. Have a look at our video walkthrough inside for a demonstration of how it works.
* After installing OkSiri, you’ll need to venture into the Settings app to configure it. The first thing you’ll need to do is setup Activator and setup a keyword.

* OkSiri uses Activator to enable listening and for executing a specific actions once the keyword is detected. The keyword defaults to “Ok Siri” but it can be changed via the tweak’s preferences.

* I setup listening to start after a double-tap of the status bar, and I setup Siri to launch once the keyword was detected. Now, whenever I say “Ok Siri,” Siri should launch and be ready to take my command.

* In theory, it’s possible to setup OkSiri to launch any Activator action once it hears the keyword, it’s not just limited to Siri. You could make iOS launch the compose new tweet pop-up whenever you say “new tweet” or you can combine some other keyword/action combination; the choice is up to you.

* With all of that being said, I found that OkSiri didn’t work as reliably as I expected. It failed to respond to my voice commands many times with the tweak active and listening, and even when it did, I found it to be buggy and unstable at times.
* Once the tweak is working reliably, OkSiri will be a fairly powerful way to execute actions at any time via voice commands. Even with the irregular responses, I recommend giving it a try, because it’s free on the BigBoss repo.
* What has your experience been like with OkSiri? Is it working fine for you? Sound off down below in the comments.
