* It’s easy to get lost in an avalanche of today’s Apple event reporting so it bears repeating that those looking to upgrade their cell phone experience to that gorgeously designed high-gloss black-clad iPhone 7, which Apple refers to as “Jet Black”, will need to opt for a more capacious—and pricier—128GB model.
* In other words, people looking to pick up an entry-level 32GB iPhone 7 in Jet Black, which costs $649 contract-free, will be out of luck.
* The new and highly glossy Jet Black finish will be offered exclusively on the 128GB and 256GB iPhone models from Apple.com, Apple Stores, Apple Authorized Resellers and select carriers.

* That’s a bummer, but if you really, really want that glossy black unibody enclosure in your hand, I guess paying an extra $100 won’t be too much of an issue to you. In fact, with 32GB now the new 16GB I’d recommend that you go for a 128GB model because 32 gigabytes will only get you so far and built-in storage is non-expandable. The other colorway that gives the iPhone 7 anodized matte appearance, called Black, is available across all three storage capacities.

* As mentioned, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and the new black finish in 32/128/256GB tiers replacing the previous 16/64/128GB ones, starting at $649 for an entry-level 4.7-inch iPhone 7 with sixteen gigabytes of storage.
* While we’re at it, Apple’s $99 Smart Battery Case for the iPhone 7 will also be offered in black and white, but you probably won’t be needing one as these are the most battery-efficient iPhones Apple’s ever made.
* Apple’s also posted a video showing how these new black iPhones are made.
