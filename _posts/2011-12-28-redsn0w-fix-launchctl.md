* Just like Corona yesterday, RedSn0w just got an update to fix the “launchctl” error that we previously reported on. By releasing RedSn0w 0.9.10b2, the Dev Team now takes care of this problem that plagued a few users on the iOS 5.0.1 untethered jailbreak.
* If you were one of those users affected by the issue, you can simply run RedSn0w 0.9.10b2 on top of your current jailbreak…
* From the Dev Team blog:
* The b2 version of redsn0w includes the launchctl-related fix by @planetbeing as mentioned by @saurik here and here.  As usual, you can just re-run redsn0w in jailbreak mode over your existing 5.0.1 jailbreak (even a PwnageTool one), making sure to de-select “Install Cydia” if you do.  Always be sure to do a controlled “slide to power off” shutdown of your device before running redsn0w.
* You can download RedSn0w 0.9.10b2 from our Download section. For more information on how to use RedSn0w, please make sure to check out our dedicated RedSn0w page, our tutorial for Mac, and our guide for Windows.
