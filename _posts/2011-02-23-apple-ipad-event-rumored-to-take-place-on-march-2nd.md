* Apple will be holding a press event next week at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Fransisco. The event is supposed to be focused on the iPad 2.
* There have been reports that Apple’s iPad announcement would be delayed, but multiple sources (including Apple) have recently confirmed that Apple will in fact hold an event next Wednesday.
* Not much information has been leaked about the approaching Apple event besides specs for the next version of the iPad. Apple might update iOS as well, but there is no hard evidence to support that claim.
* However, iPad speculation abounds. Whatever happens, this upcoming Apple event is sure to be significant.
* Kara Swisher, from AllThingsD, got the exclusive on when Apple will hold their upcoming iPad-centric event,
* “Apple will hold its much-anticipated event on March 2, where the tech giant seems poised to unveil a new version of its hugely successful iPad, according to multiple sources.”
* The New York Times and Reuters have confirmed the upcoming date,
* NY Times:
* “Now people with knowledge of the matter say that Apple will host an event on Wednesday, March 2 to showcase its new iPad. The people agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss Apple’s product plans.”
* Reuters:
* “Apple will host an event on March 2, where the company is expected to take the wraps off the newest iPad model, an individual with knowledge of the situation said. Apple declined to comment.”
* According to The Loop, Apple just sent out the invitations for an event next Wednesday. So, this next Apple event has been officially confirmed.

* 9to5 Mac reports that the iPad 2 will ship towards the end of March, following the March 2nd announcement.
* The iPad 2 will probably have a front-facing camera for video chat through FaceTime, a lighter and slimmer build, and a faster processor. Apple will probably also have a surprise in the device’s design that we haven’t been expecting.
* All signs point to there not being any iPhone-related announcements at this Apple event. iOS may be updated, but it is unclear if 4.3 will be introduced. If you’d like to read up on the iPhone 5, check out our iPhone 5 rumor roundup. MacStories also has a pretty extensive timeline of iPad 2 rumors that’s worth checking out.
* What do you expect out of an Apple event next week? Since Steve Jobs is on a leave of absence from Apple, there probably wont be the legendary “One More Thing…” at the end of the event.
