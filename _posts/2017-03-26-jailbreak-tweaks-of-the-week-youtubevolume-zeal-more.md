* As another week comes to an end, we have yet another roundup to go over all of the newest jailbreak tweaks that were released in Cydia this week.
* In this piece, we’ll talk first about all of the releases that impressed us the most from the bunch, and then we’ll quickly go over all of the rest.
* Zeal – $0.99

* Zeal is an incredible new release that lets you see more about your battery at a glance.
* It provides you with battery health information that Apple normally doesn’t give you access to, as well as convenient toggle buttons for managing your battery life more efficiently.
* The interface can be invoked with Activator and can be opened in either alert or banner mode, depending on your personal preference.
* If you’re a battery monger, and you want to see more advanced information about your device, we recommend checking out Zeal. Our full review has more information about what it has to offer.
* YouTubeVolume – FREE

* Apple’s volume HUD is just so awful, and yet the YouTube app has a very nice volume HUD. It seems Google has the right idea, so why not transfer the YouTube volume HUD to everywhere else in iOS?
* A new free jailbreak tweak called YouTubeVolume brings a YouTube-inspired volume HUD to every other part of iOS, including within apps and on the Home screen.
* With an improved look and additional accessibility, the tweak makes it easier to watch videos, play full-screen games, and access buttons inside apps without being interrupted.
