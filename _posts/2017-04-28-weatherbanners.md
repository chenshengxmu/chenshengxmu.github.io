* It’s convenient to be able to glance at weather information right on your iPhone, and a new jailbreak tweak called WeatherBanners by iOS developer Cole Cabral makes seeing said information faster and easier.
* With full Activator integration, WeatherBanners displays a notification banner with the weather conditions outside on demand, as shown above.
* In our case, because it was sunny outside and mildly chilly at the time we tried the tweak, the banner says it’s 56º Fahrenheit outside and Sunny where we’re at. The location of the weather information is conveniently drawn from the stock Weather app.
* Since the tweak integrates with Activator, you’ll need to assign it an Activator gesture. You can do that from Settings → Activator or from the Activator app on your Home screen:

* We’ve assigned the tweak the double-tap on Status Bar gesture, but you can choose any gesture you want.
* For what it’s worth, Weather information already appears throughout iOS in the Today and 3D Touch widgets. If you’re already using these widgets, the information may feel redundant, but for those who have the widgets hidden to save space for other widgets, being able to invoke a custom notification banner on demand is a nice alternative.
* One thing to note is that WeatherBanners relies on the stock Weather app for its information. That said, if you removed the stock Weather app from your iOS 10 device, you will have to reinstall it from the App Store to use this tweak as it was intedned, as third-party weather apps aren’t supported.
* As a plus, the tweak doesn’t require location services, so it’s both battery and privacy-friendly. If you’ve disabled location services for the Weather app, it will automatically use the first of any manually-stored locations in your app.
* If you’re interested in trying WeatherBanners out for yourself, you can download it for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 10 devices and requires Activator be installed for use.
