* Wow, if anyone was doubting that the iPhone 4S could compete with the latest and greatest crop of smartphones, would you like your crow served scrambled, or over easy?
* The specs are ridiculous, and the “S” wholeheartedly lives up to its name by bringing significantly more speed, to the already capable iPhone 4.
* On top of the obvious A5 processing speed increase, the 4S actually rivals 4G speeds when it comes to downloads. Not only that, but it features CDMA and GSM capabilities for true world phone functionality…
* Processor: A5 Dual Core Processor, up to 2x faster cpu, dual core graphics resulting in up to 7x faster graphics.

* Faster Downloads: It’s technically still 3G, but it’s capable of speeds that rival 4G phones in real world comparisons, thanks to the improved antenna. 14.4Mbps downloads, and 5.8Mbps uploads. These are the same maximum data speeds for 4G phones like the HTC Inspire 4G and the Motorola Atrix.

* Improved Camera: 8MP Sensor capable of macro shots, and 3264 x 2428 resolution photos. New hybrid IR filer, face detection, improved white balance, and faster photo time. In fact it heavily bests Android’s flagship Droid Bionic in this area. Just 1.1 seconds to the first photo, and half a second to the next.

* Basically, this looks like a killer device, and one that I’m happy to replace my iPhone 4 with. It looks and sounds absolutely killer. Dare I say “iPhone 5, what?”
* And that’s just the hardware end of the spectrum, coming up, we’ll have details on the new Assistant integration stemming from Apple’s purchase of Siri.
* What do you think of the specs? I’m quite satisfied!
