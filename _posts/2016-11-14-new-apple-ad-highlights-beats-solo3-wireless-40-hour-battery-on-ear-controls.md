* During the official iPhone 7 unveiling last month, Apple announced one brand new and two improved Beats by Dr. Dre headphones, all of which utilize the new Apple W1 wireless chip: Powerbeats3 Wireless, Solo3 Wireless and the upcoming BeatsX earphones. A new ad Apple posted Monday, featuring Karlie Kloss, Young M.A., Brunas Schmitz and Justine Skye, highlights some of the Solo3 Wireless features enabled by the W1 chip, like touch controls and a longer lasting 40-hour battery.
* Thanks to the in-house designed W1 chip, the Solo3 Wireless features seamless zero-configuration pairing across iCloud devices while delivering up to 40 hours of battery life, with a quick five-minute charge providing three hours of playback.
* Like Apple’s upcoming AirPods, the W1-enhanced Solo3 Wireless features dual beam-forming microphones and built-in touch controls that let you take calls, play music, adjust volume and activate Siri while on the go.
* Here’s the new ad.
* And this is the promotional video for the Solo3 Wireless headphones that Beast posted on its YouTube channel following Apple’s September 7 iPhone 7 event.
* The $299.95 Solo3 Wireless, a Class 1 Bluetooth product, is available from Apple.com in Gloss Black, Gloss White, Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Black, Violet, Product(RED).
