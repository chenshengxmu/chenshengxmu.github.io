* One of my favorite jailbreak tweaks of all time was WeatherIcon. It was a simple tweak that placed the live current temperature on the stock Weather app, significantly improving the app’s usefulness.
* LiveWeatherIcon is like the next generation of that legendary tweak. Not only does it tell the current temperature, but it also features animated weather effects to further emphasize the status of the temperature in your area.
* LiveWeatherIcon features no options or settings to establish after installation. Once you instal it, you’ll notice that the stock Weather app icon has been totally replaced with a new live animated icon.
* The new app icon still links to the stock Weather app and nothing inside the actual app has been modified. If you have multiple weather locations configured within the weather app, LiveWeatherIcon will display information from the last location displayed in the stock Weather app.
* Despite the awesome animations, I’m still more of a WeatherIcon kind of guy. I’m not a huge fan of the font overlays in LiveWeatherIcon, and I think I just prefer the more low-key look of the original WeatherIcon. That’s not to say that this tweak isn’t good, because it is; it’s just going to boil down to personal preference.
* LiveWeatherIcon is available for $1 from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you’re looking to add live weather effects to your Home screen, then look no further. Share your thoughts and opinions in the comment section below.
