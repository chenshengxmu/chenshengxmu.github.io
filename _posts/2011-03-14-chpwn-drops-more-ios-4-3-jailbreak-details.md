* The jailbreak community holds its breath as iOS hackers work diligently on a 4.3 jailbreak solution. With their latest firmware, Apple introduced ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), which is making the process a little more difficult for jailbreakers. Current jailbreak methods are available, but are extremely limited.
* But things look positive as hackers Comex and i0n1c have already shown off their jailbroken iOS 4.3 devices. Now you might be wondering, “If they can jailbreak their devices, why don’t they just release it to everyone?” Well, when these guys jailbreak their devices, they don’t plug their iPhone into the computer and click a button….
* Once an exploit is found, they have to test it out, make sure it’s stable. Then they need to write software that’s easy enough for the average joe to use, and make sure that it is stable. But nevertheless we hold vigilant. Especially interested are those who upgraded to iOS 4.3 early (despite our warnings), and early iPad 2 adopters.
* The man behind Infinidock and the co-creator of ProSwitcher, chpwn, shed a bit more light on the topic today via Twitter. While he dismisses the Pwn2Own exploits as a jailbreak solution, he does note that comex, i0n1c, and p0sixninja have “other cool stuff.” With three hackers closing in, hopefully an official jailbreak release is on pace to be released this week. As always, stay tuned to iDB for the latest jailbreak information.
* Does anyone think we’ll see the jailbreak this week?
