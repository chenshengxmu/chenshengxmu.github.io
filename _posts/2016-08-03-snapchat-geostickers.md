* Snapchat for iPhone, an ephemeral image messaging app, yesterday announced a new feature called Geostickers. Basically special stickers available in some of the biggest cities around the world, they can be applied to images and moved around before sending them. You can also stick these city-specific stickers on your Snaps.
* Geostickers are available now in Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, Washington DC, Honolulu, London, Sydney, São Paulo, Paris and Riyadh.
* Geostickers should not be confused with Snapchat’s Geofilters feature for photos taken at specific locations. Some of the available Geostickers include funny ones that promote major landmarks and laugh off local trends, like San Francisco’s skyrocketing rent prices and the tech snob culture. you must have Location Services enabled on your iPhone in order to access Geostickers.

* TechCrunch was able to spot about fifteen Geostickers in San Francisco.
* Snapchat did not list cities that may be getting Geostickers of their own in the future. Notably, Instagram’s new Stories feature lacks location filters, stickers and speed effects found on Snapchat Stories.
* Snapchat is available at no charge on the App Store.
