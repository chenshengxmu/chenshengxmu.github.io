title: Uber update drops compatibility with Apple Maps extensions and Siri integration

* An update to Uber for iPhone, dated January 22, has nixed integration with Siri and Apple Maps.
* As evidenced in the screenshots and on Reddit, choosing directions in Maps no longer shows Uber as a supported ride-sharing option for those who have the app installed on their phone.
* Having tested this on both iOS 11.2.5 and the latest beta of iOS 11.3, I can confirm that Uber’s integration with Maps is currently nonexistent. Moreover, the ride-sharing app is no longer listed as an option underneath the Ride Booking Extensions heading in Settings → Maps.
* This has been happening since Uber’s version 3.282.10000 update.
* As you can see for yourself, I can easily enable or disable Lyft’s ride-booking extension in Settings so Uber’s disappearance from Maps has nothing to do with iOS itself. Table-booking Maps extensions such as Yelp and OpenTable are working as expected.
* In addition, the ability to request an Uber through Siri has been pulled, too. Requesting an Uber through the smart assistant now yields a message ”I’m sorry, Uber hasn’t set that up with me yet”. Likewise, the option to use the app with Siri is nowhere to be found in Settings → Uber.
* On a somewhat similar note, we reported earlier this morning that Slack is now the latest major service to drop a standalone Apple Watch app from its most recent update.
* Uber is available for free on App Store.
