* Speck has announced a new partnership with Scosche to create a new iteration of their popular Presidio iPhone case that works with Schosche’s MagicMount magnetic mounts.
* Most magnetic mounts out there require you to attach a metal plate to the back of your phone, or place one behind your case. The Speck Presidio Mount iPhone case instead embeds dual steel plates within the case.
* Not only is this more aesthetically pleasing, it is also more convenient. See, if you put that metal plate behind your iPhone 8 or iPhone X and try to use it for wireless charging, it will just interfere. The plates in the Presidio Mount are instead positioned so they won’t interfere with it at all. That means you can use the case with magnetic mounts, and use wireless charging.
* If you are unfamiliar with Speck’s Presidio cases, it generally has the same construction. Two-layers of protection with their proprietary impact-absorbing rubber known as Impactium. When inside the Speck Presidio case, your phone should be able to withstand drops from up to 10 feet.
* The Presidio Mount is compatible with all magnetic Scosche MagicMounts and will support the iPhone 6, 6 Plus up to the iPhone X.
* The new cases will be available starting in February for $44.95.
