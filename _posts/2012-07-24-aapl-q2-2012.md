* Apple ahead of the markets close just announced results for the calendar 2012 second quarter, the company’s fiscal 2012 third quarter. As Apple is now an iPhone company, let’s just get down to business. Apple shipped 26 million iPhones in the quarter, representing a 28% growth over the year-ago quarter.
* The number is down substantially though, from the previous quarter, in which it sold 35.1 million handsets. Apple refreshes the iPhone annually and typically sees two gangbuster quarters after a new model is out, followed by two quarters when growth pauses as buyers await the new model.
* iPad and Mac sales, and other performance metrics after the break…
* Although Tim Cook says that his company is “thrilled with record sales of 17 million iPads in the June quarter,” Apple’s overall numbers did not impress Wall Street. AAPL is currently down $29 in after-hours trading.
