* Google has just pushed out an incremental update to its native Gmail client for iOS. The new version brings three little nice-to-haves to your email arsenal, including the ability to send email messages from your alternate email addresses and stay logged in longer.
* The biggest enhancements is the full support for iOS notifications, meaning you can now finally set up banners, alerts and lock screen options in Notification Center…
* According to iTunes release notes, Gmail for iOS version 1.2.7812 features the following changes:
* – notification Center support. Banners, alerts and lock screen notification options – “send-as”. Alternate sender support, if configured within Gmail – persistent login. Sessions no longer expire
* Google wrote in a blog post that Gmail notifications on iOS devices are now up to five times faster than in the previous version.
* If you have configured alternate sender addresses in Gmail’s web interface (Settings -> Accounts -> Send), you’ll see a From: option when composing new messages.

* Another change involves the improved login process to keep you logged in for as long as you’d like. Previously, the app would automatically log you out after your session expired.
* Gmail for iOS is a free download right from the App Store.
* Do you use the native Gmail app on your iOS device or its web-based counterpart?
