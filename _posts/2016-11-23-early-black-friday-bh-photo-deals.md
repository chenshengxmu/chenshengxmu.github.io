* We’re still a few days away from the holiday weekend, but in an effort to get a head start, several retailers have launched what they are calling “early” or “pre-” Black Friday sales. We’re going to be covering as many of these deals as possible, with a particular focus on quality products and notable discounts. Here are a few we’ve found from B&H Photo thus far.
* Note: most folks are probably aware of this, but it bears repeating for those that aren’t. B&H Photo does not charge sales tax for customers outside of NY. This can mean hundreds in savings on top of the sale price, depending on the cost of the item. They also offer free shipping on most products.
* Samsung 40-inch 4K Smart LED TV – this highly rated mid-range TV from Samsung offers a 40-inch 4K LED panel, MR 120 tech, Samsung’s Smart Hub with full web browser and screen mirroring and HDR Premium. It also has 3 HDMI inputs and 2 USB ports. This is just a few dollars cheaper than we’ve seen this TV at other stores, but the no sales tax and free shipping make this a much better deal. Available for $348 (normal price $648).
* LG 29-inch UltraWide FreeSync IPS Monitor – looking for a hi-res widescreen monitor? Check out this one from LG. It features a 2560 x 1080 widescreen 29-inch panel, 1,000:1 static contrast ratio, IPS tech for a better view from more angles and AMD FreeSync tech for enhanced gaming. Connections include HDMI and DisplayPort inputs. Available for $229 (normal price $399).
* Sony EXTRABASS Bluetooth Headphones – these Bluetooth headphones from Sony were well-reviewed at their $100+ price point, so with discount they are a no-brainer. Features include neodymium dynamic drivers, Sony’s Bass Booster tech, built-in Bluetooth and NFC, onboard microphone for fielding phone calls and up to 30 hours of battery life. Available for $78 (normal price $128).

* 12-inch MacBook 8GB RAM 256GB Storage – if the new $1,500 MacBook Pro seems a bit too pricey, consider the 12-inch MacBook. It’s thinner and lighter, but still features a Retina display and solid hardware specs. Translation: it looks great and has more than enough power for most folks. This is the latest (2016) version. Available for $1,199 (normal price $1,299).
* 13.3-inch MacBook Pro 8GB RAM 256 Storage – of course if you do need a lit bit more power, B&H Photo has great deals on the new MacBook Pro as well. In fact, I just purchased one from them myself and with no sales tax I figure I saved a total of $240. This is the non-Touch Bar, entry level model but again it has more than enough power for most folks. Available for $1,399 (normal price $1,499).
* Samsung 23.6-inch Widescreen LED UHD Monitor – and for a solid, inexpensive 4K monitor to go with one of these new laptops, check out this Samsung. It has a 3840 x 2160 panel, AMD FreeSync tech for enhanced gaming and various HDMI and DisplayPort inputs. Other specs include 4ms Response Time and 1,000:1 static contrast ratio. Available for $280 (normal price $350).
* YUNEEC Breeze iOS Connected iOS Quadcopter – yes, we mentioned this drone deal in our Amazon roundup, but again the no sales tax makes a difference with an added savings of $20-$40. The Breeze has seen mixed reviews since its debut but you’re not going to find a drone with a 4K camera, feature set and iOS compatibility at this price. Available for $399 (normal price $499).

* Nest Learning Thermostat (3rd generation) – if HomeKit-compatibility isn’t a concern, the consensus is the Nest is still the best smart thermostat on the market. It offers an intuitive design, easy installation, auto climate management with energy-saving features, and you can control it from almost any device. This seems to be the universal price, but—again—no sales tax. Available for $200 (normal price $250).
* Samsung 70-inch 4K Smart LED TV – go big or go home, right? This is actually the same model as the above-listed 40-inch set, except, well this one is some 30 inches bigger. You’re going to see some seemingly-wild deals on 4K TVs this weekend, but few will have the prestige and feature set of this one. Reviews range from 4-5 stars on most major retailer sites. Available for $1,298 (normal price $2,298).
