* The FCC announced on Tuesday that Verizon and Sprint have agreed to pay $158 million to settle their bill cramming investigations with the Commission. Verizon Wireless will pay $90 million and Sprint Corporation will pay $68 million, and much of that will go to consumer refunds.
* “For too long, consumers have been charged on their phone bills for things they did not buy,” said the oft-outspoken FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. “We call these fraudulent charges ‘cramming,’ and with today’s agreements we are calling them history for Verizon and Sprint customers.”
* In addition to money, the FCC also secured various consumer protections in the settlement, in hopes of preventing future fraudulent charges. The carriers can no longer offer third-party premium SMS charges, they must provide a way to block them, and must regularly report to the FCC.
* Premium Short Messaging Services are setup to send you gimmicky texts like ‘Daily horoscopes.’ Most of them are very easy to opt into, difficult to cancel, and cost ~$10 per month. Last fall, the FCC reached similar deals with AT&T and T-Mobile, who paid $105M and $90M respectively.
