* Following its launch of the major Tweetbot 4 update, now a universal app for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, developer Tapbots today issued a timely update focused on 3D Touch.
* If you own an iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, you can now press Tweetbot’s icon on the Home screen firmly to access the following handy shortcuts: Show Activity, Tweet Last Photo and Tweet.
* If you have unread notifications sitting in Tweetbot, this menu will provide additional options to reply to a mention or reply via a Direct Message. In addition, Tweetbot now supports Peek and Pop gestures in the timeline.
* You can Peek into stuff in your timeline by pressing the display firmly, or a little harder to Pop into content. If you Peek into a tweet and then drag your finger upwardly, a sheet appears  with options to favorite the tweet, retweet it to your followers, quote and reply to it.
* You can also press firmly on profile pictures to Peek into the user’s Twitter profile, preview URLs in tweets and much more.

* As you may have guessed, you can also use Peek and Pop gestures on images embedded in tweets. Here’s what Peeking into a tweeted out image looks like, at left, versus tapping on an image link in a tweet, at right. If you press a little harder, you’ll Pop into the image as if you tapped on its link.
