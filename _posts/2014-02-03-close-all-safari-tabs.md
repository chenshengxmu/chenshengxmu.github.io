* Last month, Christian posted a handy tip that showed how to quickly close all running tabs in mobile Safari using the private mode button. This is a great way to close all open Safari tabs for non-jailbroken users, but it’s not the best solution if you happen to be jailbroken.
* Using the private mode trick has a couple of disadvantages. First, it requires you to either enter or exit private mode whenever you want to close all tabs. Secondly, it requires one more extra button tap in order to close all tabs.
* A new jailbreak tweak named CloseAll eliminates the necessity to enter or exit private mode, and it’s faster, because it only requires two button taps instead of three. Have a look at our full video walkthrough inside to see how CloseAll works.
* After you install CloseAll, open up the Safari browser and tap the new tab button in the bottom right-hand corner. Once the new tab interface is open and all of your existing tabs are displayed, tap and hold on any of the ‘x’ buttons in the upper left-hand corner of your open Safari tabs. Doing this will close all open tabs at once.

* Tap and hold the ‘x’ button to close all tabs at once
* CloseAll is an extremely simple jailbreak tweak, and it has no options or settings to configure. Like I stated before, this is a better solution than the private mode method for closing tabs, because it can save you time and prevent needlessly entering or exiting private mode.
* You can find CloseAll on Cydia’s BigBoss repo free of charge. Let me know what you think about the tweak down below in the comments.
