* The fine folks over at AgileBits have outdone themselves with the latest update to their awesome password management application. 1Password 4, a release countless months in the making, is now officially available for purchase in the Mac App Store. To celebrate, the team behind it is offering it at $39.99 — a 20% discount.
* I’ve been a 1Password user for a littler over a year now, and I have to tell you, it’s the best thing since sliced bread. To be honest, I wasn’t much a believer at first. I used another password management tool called LastPass, and that seemed to work fine for me.
* That was until I gave 1Password a real shot. Since then, I haven’t looked back. There are just so many different facets of this application that make it the gold standard as far as password management apps are concerned. And 1Password 4 has so many subtle upgrades and painstaking attention to detail, that I feel comfortable labeling it the best password management app of all time.
* Along with a fresh coat of paint, the app brings support for iCloud, which makes it a dream to use with its iOS counterpart. If you’re already running 1Password on your iPhone, just install 1Password 4 and it’ll automatically pull in all of your password details via iCloud.

* I especially like the ability to search your saved password data from anywhere on your Mac using the handy Option+Command +\ shortcut. I use that countless times each and every day, and it makes me more productive. I also like the ability to quickly star favorites so that they appear at the top of my available login entries when browsing to login pages.
* If you already use 1Password 3, then you probably don’t need much convincing to upgrade, as you already know how beneficial this app is. But just in case you do, take my word for it. It’s more than just a fresh coat of paint, it’s a refined user experience that’s well worth the upgrade. I’ve been using 1Password 4 in beta for quite some time now, and I’m buying it as soon as soon as I’m finished with this post. Speaking of that, for those who already purchased 1Password on the Mac App Store, the upgrade to 1Password 4 is free.
* Download 1Password 4 in the Mac App Store now.
* What say you? What do you use for your password management? 1Password? LastPass? A sticky note attached to your monitor?
