* Apple today released iOS 11.2.1, a small bug-fix update for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
* The software basically restores remote access to HomeKit accessories in the Home app for shared users, that’s all. The same issue was also fixed for owners of the fourth-generation Apple TV and Apple TV 4K with the follow-up release of tvOS 11.2.1.
* According to release notes, iOS 11.2.1 fixed an issue that could disable remote access to shared users of the Home app. The company provided detailed information on the security content of iOS 11.2.1 via a support document on its website.
* As discovered by 9to5Mac a few days ago, Apple’s HomeKit platform for smart home accessories was plagued with a major vulnerability which allowed unauthorized access to HomeKit devices like smart locks. The company immediately fixed the bug server-side while also disabling remote access for shared HomeKit users as a security precaution.

* With iOS 11.2.1 released, Apple has now reinstated that functionality.
