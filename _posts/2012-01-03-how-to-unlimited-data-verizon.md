* Verizon discontinued its unlimited data plan last July, thereby joining the ranks of AT&T with tiered data offerings for smartphone users. Thankfully, a nifty trick has surfaced for getting unlimited data on Verizon, despite the CDMA carrier technically not offering its all-you-can-eat plan anymore.
* While we can’t verify the legitimacy of this method, many Verizon customers have reported that performing this workaround has indeed unlocked unlimited data…
* SlickDeals has the step-by-step tutorial:
* There’s always the chance that Verizon could notice the change and place you back on a tiered plan without your knowledge, so be careful. Reports from this morning have indicated that Verizon is starting to close the loophole, so try this tick out while you still can! And make sure to watch your monthly statement from Verizon for any changes.
* (In case you didn’t know, there’s also a roundabout way to get an unlimited data plan back on AT&T. It’s tedious, but it could be worth it if you’re really itching for an all-you-can-eat iPhone connection. Check out the loophole here.)
* Did this method work for you? Let us know in the comments!
