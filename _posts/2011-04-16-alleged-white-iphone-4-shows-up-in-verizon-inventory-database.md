* If you needed any more confirmation that the mythical White iPhone 4 is coming, here you go.
* Following yesterday’s report providing official word from Apple regarding the availability of the White iPhone 4 this Spring, comes even more confirmation. The folks over at 9to5 Mac have obtained an internal Verizon inventory document which lists the highly-anticipated White iPhone 4. 
* As seen in the document above, the 32GB white iPhone 4 is listed as model number MC679LL/A. Similar to the white and black iPad 2s, the model number for the white iPhone 4 is one digit higher than the model number (MC678LL/A) for the black iPhone 4. So while the document doesn’t explicitly mention the color of the handset, we’re pretty sure that’s the case. According to the leaked document, the White iPhone 4 will be available in both 16GB and 32GB versions.
* If Bloomberg’s report from earlier this week is correct, the White iPhone 4 will be available before the end of this month or early May for both AT&T and Verizon customers.
* After a long ten months, I would think the  people who really wanted the white color already got the iPhone 4 white conversion kit.
* What say you?
