* With the release of iOS 9 back in 2015, Apple increased the security of iOS devices by defaulting to a 6-digit passcode instead of a 4-digit passcode when setting up a new device. While this has undoubtedly made iOS devices more secure, some people prefer to use the shorter passcode option for various reasons.
* If you prefer to use a shorter passcode, we will show you how to change your iPhone or iPad passcode back to 4 digits.
* Clearly, there is a reason why Apple made the default passcode option longer: it’s because it’s incredibly more  secure. Although the odds someone might figure out your 4-digit passcode are pretty slim, these odds are still better for the thief than if you used a 6-digit passcode.
* That said, and for security reasons, we do not recommend going back to a passcode containing only 4 digits.
* However, a 4-digit passcode might be a better option for some people. For instance, iOS users with motor handicaps might find it easier to unlock their devices by punching in 4 numbers instead of 6. In this case, a 4-digit passcode is a necessity.
* 1) First things first, make sure you understand the risks of using a shorter passcode.
* 2) On your iPhone, or iPad, launch the Settings app, and go to Touch ID & Passcode (this setting is called Face ID & Passcode on iPhone X). Enter your current 6-digit passcode.
* 3) Select the Change Passcode option. Enter your current passcode again.
* 4) You will now be asked to enter your new passcode. Right above the keypad, you will notice new Passcode Options. Tap on that, then select 4-Digit Numeric Code from the popup menu.

* 5) Enter your new 4-digit numeric code, and enter it one more time to verify the passcode. Your phone or iPad will take a few seconds to register that new passcode. During that time, the device may be unresponsive. Just wait a few seconds.
*  
* And you’re all set! If you’re changing the passcode to something completely new, you might want to write it down on a piece of paper and put it in a drawer somewhere, just in case you forget that new passcode.
