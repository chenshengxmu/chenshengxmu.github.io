* The only thing better than scoring a cool gadget is scoring a cool gadget at a discount. So of course we just had to pass along this information regarding some hot deals that Best Buy will be running this weekend for smartphones and tablets.
* As noted by CNET, starting today, the electronics retailer will be offering double the trade-in value on mobile devices for folks purchasing a smartphone from one of the 3 major carriers. Additionally, it’s also taking $100 off select iPhone models…
* To get double trade-in for a device, simply bring in a working, non-cracked cell phone to your local Best Buy, and the retailer will give you double the phone’s value. You must, however, be purchasing a smartphone from Verizon, AT&T or Sprint.

* As for the $100 iPhone discount, it looks like it’s just for the 32GB iPhone 5 (black or white) model on Sprint. It’s a good deal, considering you get a 32GB for the price of a 16GB. But it also means you’d have to sign a 2-year contract with Sprint.
* Best Buy is also running promotions on a wide range of other devices this weekend, including Microsoft’s Surface Pro, which is $100 off. The retailer is also still knocking $200 off select MacBook Pro models, and another $100 for .edu students.
* If you’re going to act, do it fast. It sounds like most of these deals are going to expire Sunday.
