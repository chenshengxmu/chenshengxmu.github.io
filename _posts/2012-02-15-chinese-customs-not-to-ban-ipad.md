* Apple’s latest legal hiccup, this time with display maker Proview, looked set to escalate into all-out war when the plaintiff suggested a ban on the importing and exporting of iPads in China. The latest on the situation may serve to calm fears in Cupertino however, with the news that such a move may not be easy to execute according to Reuters.
* A full ban on the iPad would obviously prove disastrous for Apple, with the device being manufactured in China. A ban on exporting the tablet would effectively shut iPad sales down across the globe.
* Thankfully for us, though not so much for Proview, Chinese customs authorities are erring on the side of caution, suggesting that a ban may be too difficult to enforce due to Apple’s huge popularity…
* “The customs have told us that it will be difficult to implement a ban because many Chinese consumers love Apple products. The sheer size of the market is very big,” Yang Long-san, chief of Proview Technology (Shenzhen), told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday.”
* Any move to block the iPad would obviously also have a negative impact on Foxconn, the company which makes Apple’s hardware. This will no doubt also be a factor in whether a ban comes to fruition, though it is becoming increasingly unlikely.
* The issue over the iPad trademark revolves around Proview’s claim that Apple does not own the Chinese mark for the name, whereas Apple obviously disagrees.
* The case continues.
