* Sometimes the best iPhone leaks come from Apple itself.
* In an early release of the upcoming HomePod firmware, Apple has left behind a few clues that seem to reveal the existence of the next iPhone’s face detection unlocking feature, as well as the overall form factor of the device.
* First confirmed by developer Steve Troughton-Smith who dug into the code is the presence of ‘Pearl ID’ in BiometricKit, a long-rumored infrared (IR) unlocking feature based on facial recognition. IR is necessary to offer facial recognition in dark environments.

* At this point, it is not sure whether Pearl ID will be the official name of the feature, or if it will be called a more descriptive name such as Face ID.
* Adding to the findings, iOS developer Guilherme Rambo looked into the HomePod firmware as well and found out that the codename for the upcoming iPhone 8 is D22. The mention of an ‘iPhone9,9’ could relate to the upcoming iPhone 7s.
* Finally, the HomePod firmware contains a glyph for device D22 as further evidence of the overall form factor of the iPhone 8. The glyph, seen at the top of this post, shows an edge-to-edge iPhone with no apparent Home button, and a notch at the top that will likely include earpiece and various sensors, including IR.
* That glyph confirms the various iPhone 8 leaks we have seen over the last few weeks. The glyph is either a confirmation of the various iPhone 8 leaks we have seen over the last few weeks, or represents major trolling from Apple who would have gone to great length for leading iOS developers like Rambo and Troughton-Smith onto fake paths. Strangely enough, the iOS 9.9.11.0.2 for the HomePod is still available for download at the time of writing.
* With September approaching, we are sure to see more and more leaks, accidental or not, about the new upcoming devices, including iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, and HomePod.
