* U2, the famous Irish rock band from Dublin, has teamed up with Bank of America in a new promotion where the latter donates $1 for every free iTunes download of U2’s new single titled Invisible to (Product) RED’s charity which fights against AIDS.
* The promotion was announced via a Super Bowl ad and was designed to help end mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Product (RED) was founded in 2006 by U2 frontman Bono, together with Bobby Shriver of the ONE/DATA, as a way of raising awareness and funds to help eliminate AIDS in Africa…
* According to Bank of America, the new song Invisible is available as a free download from iTunes for 24 hours, ending February 3, 2014, at 11:59pm EST.
* Here’s the ad.
* Again, for every download before Monday, February 3, 2014, 11:59pm EST, the Bank of America Corporation will donate $1, up to $2 million, to the US Fund for the Global Fund to support and fund prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. The promotion, of course, requires an iTunes account and is limited to one download per iTunes account.
* You can also make individual donations through the Bank of America (RED) Program, with the funds going to the UN Foundation Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to support and fund Global Fund programs for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.
* For such donations made before December 31, 2015, Bank of America Corporation will make a donation in an equal amount (up to a maximum of $1,000 per donor in the aggregate) to the US Fund for the Global Fund, up to a maximum total corporate donation of $2 million.
* Go ahead, download Invisible now and help the world fight against AIDS.
