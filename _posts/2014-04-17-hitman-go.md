* As promised, Square Enix Montréal has brought its console-only Hitman franchise to iOS with today’s release of Hitman Go. Like past Hitman titles, this game puts you in the shoes of the franchise’s main hitman character, Agent 47.
* But unlike previous releases, Hitman Go is turn-based and involves stealth elements coupled with puzzle solving and requires a strong focus on strategy planning.
* The game features diorama-style set pieces and its turn-based approach dictates game mechanics where you navigate fixed spaces on a grid in order to avoid enemies and infiltrate well guarded locations. Your ultimate goal: taking out your target.
* The iPhone and iPad game is now available for five bucks a pop. Jump past the fold for more info…
* If you’re a fan of stealth video games such as Konami’s Metal Gear Solid series, you’ll notice that Hitman Go bears more than a passing resemblance to the genre: working your way through the beautifully rendered environments involves disguises and requires you to focus on distractions, sniper rifles, 47’s iconic Silverballers and more.
* Here’s your launch trailer.
* Key highlights include:
* The graphics are breathtaking.
