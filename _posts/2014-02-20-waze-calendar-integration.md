* An update to Waze’s free mapping, traffic and navigation app for the iPhone and iPad is about to land on the App Store later today, bringing integration with your iOS Calendar, the company wrote Thursday in a blog post.
* More importantly, this Waze refresh allows you to navigate to Calendar events with just one tap, making it easy to access location-based events stored in the iOS Calendar, right within the app.
* Waze for iPhone is available free of charge in the App Store. This particular update is expected to launch in the App Store later today…
* You can disable this feature in Waze Settings > Advanced.
* Keep in mind that Waze will display no more than two upcoming events from your Calendar in the navigation list.
* Waze was updated in November with voice search, event reporting and other features.
* After buying it last year, Google integrated Waze’s incident reports in Google Maps.
* Grab Waze free in the App Store.
* The universal 26.3MB app requires an iPhone, iPad iPod touch running iOS 5.0 or later.
