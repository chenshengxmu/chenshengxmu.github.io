* Instagram updated its iOS client last night, bringing the app to version 5.0.11. The update is small—the change log only mentions one alteration—but significant, as it takes away the auto-sharing of activity to Facebook.
* More specifically, users will now only be able to share images deliberately to Facebook using the in-app share button. So the change should go a long way in decluttering News Feeds, a common complaint amongst users…
* Here are your brief release notes:
* What’s New in Version 5.0.11
* Updated Facebook share settings: Continue sharing your Instagram photos and videos on Facebook. But Instagram likes and activity will no longer be shared on Facebook.
* It’s not clear exactly why Facebook made the change. It’s possible that with over 200 million users, the auto-posts from Instagram were really becoming an issue—either as a user annoyance or waste of server resources.
* It’s also possible this is just part of Facebook’s apparent spring cleaning. Last week the company streamlined its iOS offerings by pulling Poke and Camera from the App Store, and pushed a major update to its official client.
* At any rate, if you’re interested you can find the latest version of Instagram in the App Store for free.
