* Apple plans to unveil a new TV guide app tomorrow during its Hello Again Mac event, reports Recode. Citing a source familiar with the initiative, the site says the guide will aggregate and show content that’s available, and will work on Apple TV and iOS devices.
* Unfortunately, not all major video providers have agreed to participate in the program. Most notably, the report claims that Netflix data will not be available in the guide, which is odd considering that the two companies have worked closely together in the past.
* While everyone with a compatible device will be able to use the new guide, Apple wants to tie it in with a new “single sign-on” feature that it announced this past summer at its Worldwide Developers Conference. 
* That service lets users sign in once with participating pay TV subscription credentials to access content in any apps that support the feature. (Users currently have to sign in separately for each app that requires the credentials — a clumsy task.) Ideally, customers whose pay TV providers have agreed to the single sign-on program would see content recommendations in the guide from apps that they specifically have access to.
* The news follows a similar report from August, claiming that Apple was working on a TV guide. Wednesday morning, USA Today reported that it’s also building a Watch List app for finding and saving recommendations. It’s unknown if these will be separate apps.
* Make sure to join us tomorrow for Apple’s event, as we’ll be covering all major announcements live. It starts at 10 a.m. (PDT).
