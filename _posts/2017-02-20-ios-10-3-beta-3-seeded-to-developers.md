* Apple this morning seeded to members of the Apple Developer Program a third beta of what would become the iOS 10.3 software update with Find My AirPods and a bunch of other new features. iOS 10.3 beta 3 (build 14E5249d) is available over the air via Software Update on devices with an appropriate configuration profile installed. We’ll update the article with possible new changes discovered in beta 3 if we encounter them. New betas of macOS Sierra, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2 are available for developer testing, too.
* The first beta of iOS 10.3 was released for developer testing on January 24, which was followed by beta 2 on February 6.
* As a commenter pointed out, iOS 10.3 beta 3 updates the AirPods firmware to version 3.5.1. Our tutorials help you find out your AirPods firmware version number, teach you how to install AirPods software updates manually and provide tips for using your AirPods like a pro.
* The third beta brings out a new App Compatibility section, found in Settings → General → About → Applications, where legacy 32-bit apps are named and shamed.

* Apple says 32-bit app may slow down 64-bit devices and notes they won’t work with future versions of iOS if they are not updated. This is yet another indication that iOS 11 will most likely be 64-bit only.
* Read more about the new App Compatibility section in beta 3 here.
* iOS 10.3 includes many new features and under-the-hood improvements.
* One of the bigger ones is a Find My AirPods feature for locating your misplaced earbud through the Find My iPhone app. A one-handed floating iPad keyboard was discovered in a prior iOS 10.3 beta build, but it’s unclear if it will be exposed to users when the software launches for public consumption.

* iOS 10.3 will permit third-party apps to update their icon dynamically. This will make it so your favorite apps can convey various states on the Home screen. For example, if you upgrade to the full version of an app via the In-App Purchase mechanism, its Home screen icon may change to reflect that.
* These are just a few of the more than a dozen useful improvements and productivity-enhancing changes that iOS 10.3 will bring to the table when it becomes available publicly. For the full list of changes and improvements in iOS 10.3, be sure to check out our article and watch Andrew’s hands-on video included above.
* Betas of iOS 10.3 and macOS Sierra 10.12.4 are available for public beta-testing, too, but you’ll need to apply for Apple’s Beta Software Program first.
