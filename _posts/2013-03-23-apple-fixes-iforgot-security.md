* That was fast. Earlier today, Christian told you that a major security hole had been discovered involving Apple’s iForgot page that allowed someone to reset your Apple ID password with just your birthdate and email address.
* Unsurprisingly, Apple immediately took the password page down after getting word of the vulnerability. And after just a few hours of ‘maintenance,’ the page is back up and—we’re happy to report—once again safe to use…
* The Verge was the first to report the security hole:
* “The exploit involves pasting in a modified URL while answering the DOB security question on Apple’s iForgot page. It’s a process just about anyone could manage, and The Verge has confirmed the glaring security hole firsthand.”
* The discovery of the exploit came just one day after Apple introduced a two-step verification process that, once enabled, requires you to verify your identity from one of your devices before making account changes or purchases.
* Of course, we recommended enabling the process to help protect your Apple ID. But doing so requires a complex password. And folks who don’t have one must set one up, with a 3-day waiting period, leaving them vulnerable.
* But the good news is, Apple has fixed the exploit, and the iForgot page is safe to use again. We still, however, recommend setting up two-step verification for the added security. If you need help, we have a step-by-step tutorial.
