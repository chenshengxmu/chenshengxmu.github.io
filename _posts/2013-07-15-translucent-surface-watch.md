* Microsoft’s rumored smartwatch will reportedly compete with Apple’s rumored iWatch by designing the product around Surface and Xbox technology, while giving it a cool translucent shell along with a variety of colorized removable wrist bands for a dash of fashion statement. Oh, and it will supposedly do LTE on its own.
* Sources familiar with the matter told The Verge that prototype smartwatch testing at Microsoft has moved over to the Surface team. The move is likely in line with a recent company-wide reorganization effort that saw Xbox and Surface hardware divisions folded into a single unit, with former Windows chief Julie Larson-Green now responsible for all of Microsoft’s hardware efforts…
* Tom Warren, writing for The Verge:
* We understand Microsoft is testing prototypes with a modified version of Windows 8, with a focus on integrating the device with other Windows-powered devices.
* As for the removable wrist bands, these could include blue, red, yellow, black, white, and grey colors, the publication has learned.
* AmongTech recently asserted Microsoft was testing smartwatch prototypes featuring a 1.5-inch screen, 6GB of storage and LTE support.
* The prototypes, the story go, are encased in a shell made from Oxynitride Aluminum, a pricey translucent aluminum material said to be three times harder than glass.
* The Windows maker is also thought to have been testing a heart rate monitor dubbed Joule so perhaps this technology will be folded into the smartwatch project as well.
* The Wall Street Journal in May claimed knowledge of a Microsoft-branded touch-enabled watch device. As for Apple, patents, trademark filings, hirings and other leads all seemingly point to internal testing of an iOS-powered wrist watch device prototype.
* Originally thought to be ready in time for this year’s holiday shopping season, the iWatch device has reportedly been delayed until 2014.
* According to The Financial Times newspaper, Apple is seeking outside expertise as its wearable technology team has faced “hard engineering problems that they’ve not been able to solve”.
