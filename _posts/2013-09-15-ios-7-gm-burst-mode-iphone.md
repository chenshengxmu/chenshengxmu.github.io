* Among the many improvements Apple has made to the iPhone 5s is its redesigned rear camera. It seems like everything on the iSight shooter has been updated, from hardware to software—which includes new slow motion video and continuous burst modes.
* And as it turns out, folks with the just-released Golden Master version of iOS 7 can play with the latter feature right now. Simply open up your Camera app, and when you go to take a photo, hold your finger down on the shutter to take continuous, rapid shots…
* The feature being in iOS 7 GM is notable for two reasons. For one, as we said above, it gives you the chance to play with the new continuous burst mode early. And two, Apple never mentioned whether or not it would work with devices other than the iPhone 5s.

* We can confirm that the new burst mode works with at least the iPhone 5, iPhone 4s, iPod touch 5th generation, and iPad 3, running iOS 7 GM, and from what we can tell, it doesn’t work with the iPhone 4, presumably because of hardware limitations. Update: a few readers confirm the feature works on iPhone 4 too.
* It’s also worth noting that the feature does not offer true continuous burst mode at 10 pictures per second as the one you’ll find on the iPhone 5s. Additionally, what Apple calls a “real time analysis” of your photos is nowhere to be found on any device. Real-time analysis is where your phone looks at all of the photos you’ve taken and suggests individual shots or a sequence of photos that you might like best. It’s safe to assume this will be an iPhone 5s feature only.
* At any rate, it’ll be interesting to see if Apple decides to keep this around for other devices in the public build of iOS 7, or makes it exclusive to the iPhone 5s. We combed through both iPhone 5c and iOS 7 marketing stuff, and didn’t see the feature mentioned once.
* Do you have iOS 7 GM on your iPhone? Does burst mode work for you?
