* You wanted a new Remote app for iOS? You got it. At its WWDC keynote today, Apple introduced a completely rebuilt app for controlling your Apple TV. It has essentially the same features as the physical Siri remote that comes with the fourth generation ATV.
* The app uses touch, voice to control Siri, and motion controls to play games. And of course you can enter text! There’s no word yet on when the update will become available, but obviously we’ll let you know as soon as we hear something.
