* It wasn’t long ago that we showed you Avertas, a jailbreak tweak that ported Auxo’s famous Hot Corners and Quick Switcher features to pwned iOS 11 handsets.
* But if you’re in the market for something new rather than a port of something older, then we recommend turning your attention toward a new free jailbreak tweak called Adagio by iOS developer XCXiao.
* Adagio is a polished quick-access App Switcher for iOS 11 devices, and best of all, you can access it with a simple swipe from the left side of your display.
* The screenshot examples above depict what the Adagio interface looks like. The vertical column populates with a list of your recently-used apps, and you’ll notice that it supports both dark and light theme modes.
* You can tap and hold on any of the icons inside of Adagio to select and launch a windowed version of its respective app. Alternatively, you can tap on an icon to start its app in full-screen mode.
* Adagio adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure it to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* Upon configuring the tweak, you can use the Respring button that the developer includes at the bottom of the preference pane to save your changes.
* In our testing, we found Adagio to be more aesthetically pleasing and functional than the stock App Switcher. One of our favorite features of Adagio is the windowed app mode, which lets you see what’s happening in an app without physically launching it in full-screen mode.
* If you’re interested in giving Adagio a try, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Depending on your workflow, Adagio could make an excellent addition to your jailbroken iOS 11 device.
* What are your thoughts about Adagio and what it offers? Let us know in the comments below.
