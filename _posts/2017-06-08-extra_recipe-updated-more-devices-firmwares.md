title: extra_recipe updated with support for more devices and firmwares

* As we reported a couple of weeks back, a new jailbreak for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus has come onto the scene. The work of developer xerub, the tool was dubbed extra_recipe and initially supported only Apple’s most recent flagship devices, and only on iOS 10.1.1. However, subsequent updates are quickly changing that.
* With Luca Todesco’s help, Beta 3 saw Substrate support added, as well as Cydia itself. Yalu+mach_portal was made obsolete at this stage for the iPhone 7(+) running iOS 10.1.1, and its retirement was fully completed with the addition of iOS 10.0.x support in Beta 4. Due to the greater stability of the extra_recipe method, it is advised that all iPhone 7(+) devices which previously made use of mach_portal switch over to the newer tool now.
* But that’s not the end of the story. Preliminary support for iOS 10.0.0 has now been added for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, a feature which not even the original mach_portal tool had. Flagship devices are therefore now covered all the way from iOS 10.0.0-10.1.1 under extra_recipe.
* Please bear in mind however that a compiled .ipa of these changes has not yet been released; the amendments have been made to the GitHub project and are awaiting final tweaking before being released to the end user.
* For an encore, xerub has now begun adding support for more devices, including those which are already supported by Yalu102 (iOS 10.0.1-10.2). This seems to be an effort to offer better stability to specific devices which have apparently suffered under Yalu.
* Although it’s been rock-solid for me on both iPhone 6 and iPhone SE on iOS 10.2, problems have been reported on devices such as the iPad Air 2. For this reason, initial support has now been added for the iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 (WiFi), iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus (TSMC), and iPhone 6.
* The tool currently works on these devices on iOS 10.2 only, does not include Substrate, and as mentioned above, does not have a compiled .ipa available. In time, it’s likely that other firmwares, chip types (Samsung/TSMC) and devices will be added, and that a full release with Cydia and Substrate will be announced.
* At present, the supported list consists of the following:
* Expect the holes to be filled fairly quickly as offsets for other devices are added. In principle, extra_recipe can cover all the device/firmware combinations of Yalu and mach_portal combined, though whether that is necessary or likely remains to be seen.
* We’ll let you know once a release is available which bundles the additional device support and Substrate, for those who want to try it out instead of Yalu102.
* For now, the only people I advise to switch to extra_recipe are iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus users on iOS 10.0.0-10.1.1. All other devices are still currently better served by Yalu102.
* Have you tried out extra_recipe on your flagship phone yet? Are you planning to try it on an older device, instead of using Yalu, when the time is right?
