title: Upcoming tweak puts customizable app shortcuts to your iOS lock screen
---
* The iPhone’s lock screen has got to be the source of endless inspiration for jailbreak developers and conceptual artists who are constantly coming up with new ways to broaden functionality of your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. UI designer @Sentry_NC of the Auxo fame thought long and hard about juicing up the iPhone’s lock screen and came up with this concept showing how the iOS lock screen pulley grabber could be for more than just the camera app.
* What’s best, we heard that jailbreak developer Rudolf Lichtner is already working on turning his idea into a reality. As always, our own Jeff Benjamin will be monitoring the progress of this tweak and sharing his hands-on impressions as soon as the finished code hits Cydia…
* In addition to pulling the grabber up to reveal the Camera app (or lock screen toggles, if you use the SwipeCam tweak), this concept has your dragging your finger horizontally across a row of shortcut icons for the Phone, Messages, Music or other customizable apps.
* Stop your finger over, say, the Messages icon and simply drag upwards to reveal your messages right beneath the lock screen, just like that and without having to punch in your passcode first.
* Android Jelly Bean has a similar feature that lets you put app shortcuts on the lock screen for quick access to up to four applications of your choosing.
* According to Rudolf, the tweak is currently in the works.
* @brian8496 No ETA.

* He’s also saying the Grabber Shortcuts tweak will be customizable so people can put their favorite apps under the pulley grabber. The concept definitely looks cool, but as no release date has been set for the actual tweak, we’ll just have to wait it out.
