* If you’re buying or selling on eBay, you can now receive gentle alerts on your wrist for your tracked items on the popular e-commerce service.

* “Within each of these sections are the key details you would need to know at a glance – like the time left on an auction, the current price, the number of bids, item photos, etc,” TechCrunch notes.
* Sellers can even place new bids directly from their wrist, see a chart of their 30-day revenue in their sections and reply to messages received from other users with dictation.
* The app’s glance view is available by swiping up from the main watch face. All told, there’re 28 different types of rich notifications supported by the app related to bidding, watching, selling, messaging and more. As if that were;t enough, you can even customize these rich alerts to your liking within eBay for iPhone.
* Speaking of which, eBay for iOS has been updated with support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen resolution, regional support for additional payments in Germany and India, as well as a few other nice-to-haves.
* eBay 3.6 changelog:
* eBay had been briefly featured among the list of launch apps for the Apple Watch ahead of its April 2015 release before it got removed from Apple’s website because it wasn’t quite ready for prime time.
* The app is a brainchild of eBay’s New Technology Group, which employs over 200 engineers in product development in Portland. Interestingly enough, this group will also be developing solutions for CarPlay and Apple TV, which currently does not support downloadable third-party apps.
* Download eBay free in the App Store.
