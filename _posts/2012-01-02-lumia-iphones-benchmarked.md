* Geeks really like benchmarks — they’re one of the best ways to compare hardware speeds, and things are no different in the world of smartphones.
* With the aim of comparing the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, and Nokia’s Windows Phone 7-powered Lumia 800, YouTube user 359gsm set about running a selection of web-based benchmarks to see just which of the three phones is the quickest when it comes to rendering web pages.
* The iPhone 4S did particularly well in the tests, with the older iPhone 4 more than holding its own, too…
* Comparing the iPhone’s Mobile Safari with Windows Phone 7’s Internet Explorer Mobile will always raise a few eyebrows, especially with Microsoft making so much noise about its own offering. Interestingly, when the video shows all three devices running Microsoft’s own “speed reading” test, the iPhone 4S is the clear winner.
* The reason this is so interesting is that Microsoft used the iPhone 4 as a comparison to Windows Phone 7 not that long ago, showing how much faster Internet Explorer was than Safari. It seems that someone at Apple saw the comparison, and the iPhone 4S more than makes up for the iPhone 4’s lackluster performance!
* Check out the full results below, and remember that the iPhone 4 is running iOS 4.3 while the iPhone 4S is using the 5.0 version of iOS. No, we’ve no idea why they decided not to upgrade the iPhone 4, either!
