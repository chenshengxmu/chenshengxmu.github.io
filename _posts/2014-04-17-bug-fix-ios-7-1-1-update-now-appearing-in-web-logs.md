* It’s been nearly a month since Apple released iOS 7.1 and now the firm is seemingly prepping the first bug fix update, iOS 7.1.1. As you know, iOS 7.1, the first major update to Apple’s revamped mobile operating system, debuted last September.
* It’s brought out built-in CarPlay support, Siri and Touch ID improvements, UI tweaks, major bug fixes, improved performance (especially on older devices like the iPhone 4) and a bunch of nice-to-haves.
* According to online reports, iOS 7.1.1 is now appearing in web analytics tools, indicating Apple has now started testing the software with a wider group of employees ahead of the official release…
* Devices running upcoming iOS builds typically appear in web analytics tools as originating from areas surrounding Apple’s campus.
* This seems to be the case with iOS 7.1.1. Therefore, we can be pretty certain that this in fact is Apple testing the update internally rather than some joker taking us for a ride using a device with a modified user agent.
* Here’s a snapshot of our web analytics showing traffic spike from iOS 7.1.1 devices.

* We’re not sure what new features iOS 7.1.1 contains.
* If the version number is anything to go by, it’s going to be a maintenance update with additional bug fixes, as some watchers speculated.
* Apple should put iOS 7.1.1 betas up in its developer portal for early download, but don’t count on it as the update could be hitting your devices real soon as an over-the-air download.
* iOS automatically downloads OTA updates when your device is on Wi-Fi, prompting you right after the download completes. Starting with iOS 7.1, folks who don’t want to install an OTA iOS update can now delete its installer in Settings > General > Usage.
