* Don’t you just hate it when you need to position your character in a specific spot, but you can’t accurately do so due to the iPhone’s lack of single character movement? I think we’ve all been there.
* Fortunately, SwipeShiftCaret solves that issue by allowing you to swipe your finger on the screen to move a character space either left or right.
* It’s an extremely simple tweak with no settings, but it makes editing on an iOS device so much more intuitive…
* A mere swipe of the screen is all it takes to position your cursor exactly where it needs to be to make your necessary edits. Really, iOS should have had a feature like this since the very beginning. The fact that it’s still not here in iOS 5 is kind of baffling to me.
* For jailbreakers, you can stop tearing out your hair now. SwipeShiftCaret is available for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo.
* Don’t you think this will save you a lot of time and frustration?
