* With all of the distractions and sensationalism in the tech media these days, it’s tough to really understand how Apple is doing as a company. It seems like every rumor is followed by an ‘Apple is doomed’ report, and it probably doesn’t help that it’s so secretive.
* But never fear, as usual, Joy of Tech is here to help clear up some of the confusion in a way that only it can. The comic creator has put together a Status page—yeah, similar to the one Apple made for its Dev Center—to show where Apple is at on a lot of things…
* Here’s your comic (via AllThingsD):
* There’s actually some pretty good ones in there. For example, Maps’ status of ‘Getting There’ makes sense, as it’s gotten a lot better since it launched last year. Others are a ways off, though, like the Status of ‘Uh Oh’ Bob Mansfield, who seems to be doing just fine.

* My favorite has to be the ‘Danger’ status of how long Apple can keep saying it has amazing new products in the pipeline. Apple has always oversold itself, but its year-long absence from the new product circuit makes the statement noticeably more insipid than usual.
* Here’s hoping it’s a busy fall.
* Anyway, which one is your favorite?
