* About an hour ago, Apple announced its biggest quarter in company history. Tim Cook’s team sold more iPhones and made more money than Apple ever has in a three month period.
* Also on today’s list of Apple’s broken records is the amount of Apple TVs it sold during the holiday quarter. Apparently, the little $99 media box is a $100 million dollar product for the company…
* Cook announced today that Apple sold 1.4 million Apple TV 2s during its Q4 of 2011 — the most it’s sold in a quarter since it released the iOS-based device back in October of 2010. But despite its success, the CEO still describes the device as a hobby.
* “I can’t live without my Apple TV. We still classify this as a hobby, but we continue to add things to it. We will continue to pull strings and see where we can take it.”
* Apple has long been rumored to be working on a full-blown, connected TV set. We’ve heard a lot of gossip regarding its screen size(s) and other features, but obviously none of it has materialized yet.
