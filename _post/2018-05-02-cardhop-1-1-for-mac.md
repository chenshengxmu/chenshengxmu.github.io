* Developer Flexibits today updated its contact-management Mac app Cardhop with some handy new features, such as smart groups, support for printing contacts in a variety of formats, the ability to add notes with timestamps and more.
* Cardhop 1.1 for macOS, the first major point update following the app’s inaugural release on Mac App Store in October 2017, finally permits users to create dynamic smart groups that automatically update based on specific search criteria, similar to Smart Playlists in iTunes.
* This should make creating and managing custom, auto-updating contact groups based on specific criteria a breeze, like company, location, link domains and more. You can now customize fields and labels that appear when creating a new contact in Cardhop simply by adjusting the default contact card template within the app’s preferences.

* Printing support lets you print customized envelopes, labels and lists of contacts, which is useful for mailing lists. To print a contact/group, type “print” or use a new Quick Action.
* If you turn on the new option “Add Notes with Timestamp,” Cardhop will insert the current date/time into the notes of a contact so you know when you last updated the card. This lets you help keep a timeline of interactions and details with each contact.
* Lastly, typing into a related name field now suggests other names in your contacts.

* The app has also picked up support for five new languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, English and Japanese. Localization extends to support for the app’s awesome parsing engine, as well as the local address and phone formats.
* Considering that the native Contacts app on macOS is pretty bad and that until now there were no viable alternatives out there, Cardhop is worth of your consideration.

* Its parsing engine lets you search, add, edit and interact with your contacts using a simple sentence. As an example, just type in “John G” and John’s card will instantly appear.
* From there, you can launch quick actions with a press of a button. The parsing engine supports actions for Twitter, Skype, VoIP, FaceTime Audio, FaceTime Video and more.
* Or, enter “Sarah Smith sarah@cardhopapp.com” and Cardhop will add the provided email address to Sarah’s existing card. Likewise, if you type in “call Seb” the app will instantly start a phone call with Sebastien on your Mac, through your iPhone.
* Cardhop uses the system database so any changes made to any of your contacts within the app get instantly reflected in the Contacts app across all your devices, and vice versa.

* Today’s update is provided at no additional charge to existing users of the app. Cardhop requires macOS El Capitan 10.11 or later.
* Cardhop is $19.99 on Mac App Store.
