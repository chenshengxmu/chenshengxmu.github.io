* Google’s native Maps application for the iPhone and iPad now includes a handy option to send a place you search for on desktop to your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Before you can use this handy feature, you must update to Google Maps 4.7 for iOS or later, and enable this option in settings. In this post, I’m going to teach you how to set up and use this feature so you can easily send any place from Google Maps on your desktop to your iOS device.
* Before you can take advantage of sending places from desktop to mobile, notifications must be enabled on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad and you must be signed in to Google Maps on your computer and mobile device with the same account.
* Step 1: Open Google Maps on your iPhone or iPad.
* Step 2: Tap on the icon in the upper left corner to reveal the lefthand menu. Now tap Setting > Notifications and enable “Sent from desktop maps”.
