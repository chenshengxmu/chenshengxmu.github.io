* The first time we heard that Apple was working on a 12+ inch iPad, we dismissed it as a crazy rumor. Why on earth would the company want to go larger than its current 9.7-inch tablet, which already seems to be getting eclipsed by the 7.9-inch mini?
* But the more you hear a rumor, the harder it gets to ignore. And tonight, for the third time, a report has surfaced claiming that Apple is indeed moving forward with plans for this larger iPad, and it has already tapped Quanta Computer to produce it…
* Macotakara points to the report from United Daily News (rough Google translation):
* “Quanta notebook shipments by 2014 fear continues to decline, coupled with major customers Apple notebook shipments next year will decline, even two days to sell off foreign Dada ten thousand wide. But the market also reported, Quanta is working with Apple to develop large-size 12-inch iPad.”
* Oddly enough, Quanta Computer is an Apple supplier mainly responsible for computers like the MacBook Air, and tablet production is typically left up to suppliers like Foxconn and Pegatron. But the report does mention that Quanta is looking to diversify.

* News of a larger-sized iPad first surfaced back in May, when Korean site ETNews.com claimed Apple was working on a tablet with a display measuring 12.9 inches diagonally. And the story was independently confirmed in a July report by The Wall Street Journal.
* Though the larger iPad is rumored to debut as early as the first half of next year, there’s no evidence supporting that it’ll even make it to market. Apple is, however, expected to unveil a redesigned iPad 5 and an iPad mini with Retina display in October.
