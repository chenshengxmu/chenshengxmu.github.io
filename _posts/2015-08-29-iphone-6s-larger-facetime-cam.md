* Some new photos surfaced this weekend, showing what is said to be the front face of an iPhone 6s. 9to5Mac shares the high resolution images of the claimed component, which appears to offer up insight into two of the unannounced handset’s new features.
* The first is a higher resolution FaceTime camera. We’ve been hearing rumors for a while now that the iPhone 6s will feature an improved front-facing camera for taking better selfies, and if legitimate, this part confirms it with a larger FaceTime camera sensor.

* The second rumored feature the component seems to verify is Force Touch. As noted by 9to5Mac, the back of the part shows hardware believed to power the technology, which allows a device to use the force of a user’s touch on its screen as an input method.
* Other big changes expected for the iPhone 6s include a 12MP iSight camera with full 4K capabilities, software-based flash feature for the FaceTime camera, a faster A9 processor, 2GB of RAM, upgraded Touch ID sensor and a new Rose Gold color option.
* Apple will likely unveil the new handset, alongside a larger iPhone 6s Plus variant, at its media event on Wednesday, September 9. The company is also presumed to use the stage to introduce a long-awaited update for its Apple TV, and possibly new iPads.
