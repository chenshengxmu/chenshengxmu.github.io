* Apple and Nokia have gone head to head in a couple of arenas. First it was the mobile phone market and then it was the court room. Although Nokia has typically faired better than the Cupertino company due to their extensive Global reach, Apple has been right on their heels.
* At least they were on their hills, until yesterday. Everybody is talking about Apple’s impressive 25 billion dollar quarter, heck they sold close to 20 million iPhones in just 3 months. But how much of their posted revenue is directly from mobile phones, and how does it compare to Nokia’s earnings?
* Reuters is reporting today that Apple became the world’s largest phone vendor by revenue in Q2 of this year. Their iPhone generated $11.9 billion in revenue from January to March, while previous leader Nokia’s phone revenue came in at $9.4 billion.
* Analyst Alex Spektor of Wireless Device Strategies noted to investors today that, “With strong volumes and high wholesale prices, the PC vendor has successfully captured revenue leadership of the total handset market in less than four years.”
* This is obviously subject to change with Nokia’s recent adoption of Microsoft’s mobile operating system. In fact, the announcement of the partnership may have attributed to Nokia’s declining handset revenues over the January – March quarter. Who wants to buy an obsolete Symbian handset?
* What do you think? Will Apple stay the highest grossing mobile phone maker?
