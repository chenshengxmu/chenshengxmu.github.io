* I can’t believe it’s already June. It seems like just yesterday we were talking about the possibility of an April iPad event, and now we’re less than a week away from WWDC, and two months away from WWJC.
* This year’s World Wide Jailbreak Conference will be a 2-day affair, hosted at the Raddison Hotel in New Rochelle, New York. And whether you plan on attending or not, you can show off your jailbreak spirit with these Limited Edition WWJC 2013 iCarbons skins…
* We’ve talked about our affinity for iCarbons skins before. They’re made of high quality 3M materials, and are fairly easy to install. And these Limited Edition micro-etched skins aren’t any different. Here, check out this video:
* If you’re interested in the skin, it comes in both brushed titanium and brushed aluminum, with a number of ‘accent’ color choices. And it’s available for the iPhone 4, 4S and 5. A full set of front, back and side skins costs $24.95. Or each can be purchased separately.
* Get yours here!
* If you’d like to know more about WWJC, we have a few good posts on the subject:
* The event takes place on August 23rd and 24th.
