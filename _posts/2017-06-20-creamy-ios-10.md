* Among the slew of interface changes iOS 11 brings to the table, one of first things you’ll notice after picking up a device with the new operating system installed on it is the redesigned passcode keypad.
* If you like the way it looks, but you won’t be upgrading this Fall in order to keep your jailbreak, a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed Creamy (iOS 10) by iOS developer ijapija00 can be used to mimic the aesthetics of the iOS 11 passcode keypad on your jailbroken device.
* Following installation, you’ll notice how the tweak impacts your passcode keypad right off the bat. You can also head to the Settings app to configure a couple of options:

* Here, you can toggle the tweak on or off on demand and toggle a light mode feature. Light mode is best used with darker wallpapers where the passcode keypad ends up too dark for visual comfort. If you have a lighter wallpaper, then using the stock dark mode is probably good enough.
* Below, we show an example of the light mode, which you can compare to the first image in this post:

* Creamy (iOS 10) does a great job of replicating the look and feel of the iOS 11 passcode keypad. Although it’s not a pixel-for-pixel match, it’s still difficult to tell them apart, even when you have both of them sitting right in front of you.
* If you’re interested in trying Creamy (iOS 10), you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. It’s intended for jailbroken iOS 10 devices only.
