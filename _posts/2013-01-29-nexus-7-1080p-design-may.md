* More tablet news for you this morning. After Apple officially announced via a press release that the new 128GB iPad 4 option is launching on February 5 (is it too pricey? You tell us!), we’re hearing now that Google and its manufacturing partner Asus are working on a 2nd gen Nexus. The re-tooled version of the popular low-cost tablet is said to sport a display with 1080p resolution (1,920-by-1,080 pixels) and the skinnier side bezels akin to Apple’s iPad mini.
* It should cost the same as the first-generation model (between $199-249, depending on networking and storage options) and will run Google’s upgraded Jelly Bean-based Android operating system…
* The sometimes reliable DigiTimes talked to sources who saw the recently released engineering samples of the second-gen Nexus 7, pointing out that the $249 Nexus 7 is currently the best-selling model.
* Combined shipments of both current and second-gen model are expected to reach ten million units in 2013. By comparison, Apple in the holiday quarter reported 23 million iPad sales.
* According to the trade publication, Google should formally announce the new Nexus 7 in May.
* We previously reported that Google’s annual developer conference runs from May 15 through May 17, 2013 so it’s fairly safe to assume that the Internet giant will use the Google I/O 2013 as a launchpad for the refreshed lineup of Nexus devices.

* Are you looking forward to the new Nexus 7?
* And, what’s your experience been with the Google tablet?
* I own a Nexus 7 and am replacing it these days because the battery died and the display clicks inside when I hold the device in my hand. It should be suffice to say that I like what Google’s doing here, but am displeased with build quality.
* In terms of manufacturing, design and fit and finish, nothing currently comes close to the iPad mini, if you ask me.
