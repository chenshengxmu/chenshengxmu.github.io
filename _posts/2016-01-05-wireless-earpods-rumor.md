* Following a November 2015 claim by the Japanese blog Macotakara which asserted that Apple will ditch the standard 3.5mm headphone port on an ‘iPhone 7’ to focus exclusively on supporting Lightning-enabled headsets and wireless headphones, a new supply chain rumor published Tuesday by Chinese websites Anzhuo.cn and Feng claims that the Cupertino firm will actually bundle the next iPhone with a wireless version of its EarPods headphones to make up for the missing headphone jack.
* So, EarPods are about to go the wireless Bluetooth route.
* If I had to speculate, I would say that the company might even replace the EarPods with one of Beats’ wireless headphones, though that could be a stretch.
* As for Lightning-enabled headphones, these should make use of the iPhone’s Lightning port for both charging and headset capabilities, the reports claim.
* But if you still prefer conventional wired headphones, Apple will reportedly provide you with a Lightning adapter to connect conventional 3.5mm headphones to your iPhone 7.
