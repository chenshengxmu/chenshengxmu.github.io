* We still don’t know when Apple’s multi-device AirPower wireless charging mat is coming, but if you need a Qi charger for your iPhone, Logitech just unveiled a new wireless charger for iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus that lets you use your phone while it’s being charged.
* Logitech said Monday that the Powered Wireless Charging Stand, as they’re calling it, was designed in collaboration with Apple. It supports the faster 7.5-watt wireless charging standard on iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, or 5W charging for all other Qi-enabled devices.
* This charging accessory has a few novel features worth mentioning.

* For starters, your phone doesn’t need to be perfectly aligned with the stand to complete the charging circuit. The rubberized u-shape cradle keeps your iPhone stable even with a protective case up to 3mm thick.

* The following feature is also cool:
* Enjoy safe, silent charging. Powered utilizes internal heat sensors to intelligently manage temperature and prevent overheating. If temperatures start to rise too high, a cool-down process kicks in automatically, eliminating the need for noisy fans.
* The built-in charging indicator light shines subtly to avoid disturbing your sleep. And if a foreign metal object is detected that might interfere with charging, Powered will blink to alert you.

* The charger holds the phone in an upright position while its being charged, allowing you to use apps, unlock with Face ID, conduct FaceTime video calls, enjoy your photos and more—all while charging the device.
* In fact, the accessory was designed for both portrait and landscape orientation. That’s right, you can even watch movies in landscape orientation while the phone is charging.
