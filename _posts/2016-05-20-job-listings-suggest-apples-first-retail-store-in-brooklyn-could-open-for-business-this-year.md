* Following setbacks, Apple’s first retail store in Brooklyn, New York City’s most populous borough, could open some time this year.
* That’s because the company’s now started a recruiting process for the Brooklyn area. The store should be located at 247 Bedford Avenue, at the corner of North 3rd Street, in Williamsburg.
* A series of job post on Apple’s website, first spotted by MacRumors, advertise positions for Creatives, Experts, Geniuses, Specialists, Business Leaders and management, with LinkedIn ads seeking a Retail Manager and Senior Manager specifically in Brooklyn.
* Apple is thought to have negotiated a long-term $66 million lease for a 20,000-square-foot space for the upcoming store. Construction has been ongoing since 2015.
* According to The New York Post in December 2014, the two-story brick structure “is getting a whole new look, featuring dramatic, arched windows.” The building now has the facade while the windows are going in, suggesting the store may open later this year.

* In addition to its Manhattan stores (Fifth Avenue, Grand Central, SoHo, Upper East Side, Upper West Side and West 14th Street), the Cupertino firm is said to be eying a store inside the Westfield shopping complex at the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan.
* In celebrating the 15th anniversary of the first Apple Store, the company yesterday invited media for a detailed preview of its refreshed retail design in a brand new flagship Union Square store in downtown San Francisco, due to open on Saturday.
