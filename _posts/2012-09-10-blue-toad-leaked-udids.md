title: Publishing firm Blue Toad says it's to blame for leaked UDID list

* So this is kind of interesting. Remember that list of 1 million Apple device IDs that the hacking group AntiSec claims it stole from the FBI and then leaked online? Well it may not have actually come from the FBI.
* According to a new report, the UDIDs in the list matched up with data from Blue Toad, a digital publisher that specializes in bringing hard copy content to the internet. And the company is taking full responsibility…
* NBC News:
* “Paul DeHart, CEO of the Blue Toad publishing company, told NBC News that technicians at his firm downloaded the data released by Anonymous and compared it to the company’s own database. The analysis found a 98 percent correlation between the two datasets. That’s 100 percent confidence level, it’s our data, Dehart.”
* Of course, the CEO’s confession really works out well for the FBI, who responded to last week’s hack by saying that while it was aware of the purported compromised data, there was no evidence it came from the FBI.
* Apple, for its part, also denied involvement in the privacy scare. And it promised that new APIs in the upcoming iOS 6 release would replace the use of UDIDs, and that it would be banning the future use of the data.
* This story continues to get weirder and weirder. And we’re hoping that AntiSec, again, the group of hackers responsible for the leak, will release some information at some point to help clear the air of confusion.
* Until then, it looks like Blue Toad did it.
* What are your thoughts on this whole mess?
