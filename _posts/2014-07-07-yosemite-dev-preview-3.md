* In addition to seeding the third beta of iOS 8 this morning, Apple has also released the third Developer Preview of its new OS X Yosemite operating system. The update comes three weeks after Preview 2, and over a month after Apple announced Yosemite at WWDC.
* The update is labeled as build 14A283o and can be downloaded via an update in the Mac App Store, or as a full download from Apple’s online developer center. It does not, however, appear to be out in Apple’s recently-launched public Yosemite Beta Seed program yet…
* The previous beta brought about just a handful of changes including a new Screen Sharing option to block others, a revamped Tim Machine interface and more. It also re-added the Photo Booth app with an all-new icon and enhancements for Handoff and AirDrop features.
* We’re currently installing the Developer Preview 3 ourselves, and will be reporting back with any notable changes, so make sure you keep checking back with us throughout the day. If you find something not mentioned here, feel free to e-mail us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
