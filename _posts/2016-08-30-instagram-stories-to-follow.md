* Today, Instagram’s Explore tab will start showing some users a bar of Stories from accounts they could follow, TechCrunch reported yesterday, saying these algorithmically personalized suggestions will roll out to everyone soon. Stories recommendations are based on who you follow and the topics you care about, making it easy to add someone new to your Home feed’s Stories section.
* While you can access recommended Stories without following their creators, gaining daily access to someone’s Stories isn’t possible without following them first.
* The Facebook-owned mobile photo-sharing service also revealed for the first time that a hundred million people out of its 500 million monthly actives visit the Explore section every day, making it perfectly suitable for presenting Stories recommendations.

* “Some seek it out as the primary way they use Instagram. Some people view it as a dessert,” as per Instagram’s Director of Product Management, Blake Barnes.
* If you don’t see recommended Stories in your Explore tab yet, don’t panic as the feature is a staggered release so it’s going to be rolling out over the next few days.
