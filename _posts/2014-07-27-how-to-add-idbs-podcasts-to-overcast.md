* Marco Arment’s new podcasting app, Overcast, is undoubtedly a fantastic listening tool. However, if you have been using another podcast app, it may be difficult finding and importing your favorites into Overcast, such as iDB’s Let’s Talk Jailbreak and Let’s Talk iOS. Have no fear, dear reader, as upon finishing this post, you will be hearing the fantastic podcasts (including Jeff’s silky smooth voice) in Overcast.
* Adding Let’s Talk iOS to your feed in Overcast is quite simple, actually. Upon launching Overcast, tap on the “+” icon at the top right corner. This will take you to the feed additions and suggestions screen.
* In reality, there are two ways to add Let’s Talk iOS to your podcast lists, but the simplest way is tap “Search Directory” at the top of the screen and type in “Let’s Talk iOS.”

* After tapping the show title, the app will display some more info on the podcast and offer a subscribe button. Simply choosing this option will add Let’s Talk iOS to your feed and begin downloading the latest episode.

* While Let’s Talk iOS is pretty easy to subscribe to, its cousin Let’s Talk Jailbreak is a little more difficult. Because Let’s Talk Jailbreak is not on iTunes, it won’t display in Overcast quite like other podcasts. However, we at iDB know you need your weekly jailbreak fix, so here is a little work around to listen to the podcast.
* First, you’re going to want to copy this link, which is the podcast’s RSS feed. When opening Overcast, click the “+” (similar to the first step in Let’s Talk iOS) and click “Add URL” at the top right. The app should auto-fill the URL into the box, but if not, simply paste it in and hit “Done” on your keyboard.
* Note: If you are using a jailbroken device with a third-party keyboard, you may need to switch over to the stock keyboard. I use Fleksy with the Fleksy Enabler tweak and I encountered this problem.
* Upon hitting done, you will now begin downloading the first episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak!
* Of course, if you haven’t downloaded Overcast, pick it up in the App Store for free.
