* Apple on Monday pushed out the iOS 10.1 software update for iPhone and iPad. The release comes after more than a month of beta testing, and it includes various improvements and one major new user-facing feature: Portrait mode, which is exclusive to the dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus.
* First introduced at Apple’s iPhone event in September, Portrait mode is a new setting in the stock Camera app that uses the 7 Plus’ wide angle lens to gather perspective data for a photo. This allows the handset to take photos with a depth-of-field, or ‘bokeh,’ effect with blurry backgrounds.
* In addition to Portrait mode, iOS 10.1 also includes the ability to reduce motion while retaining the various iOS 10 iMessage features. The new toggle labeled “Auto-play Message effects” can be found in General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion. You’ll also see a new Replay option in Messages.
* iOS 10.1 also comes with transit directions for users in Japan.
* Rounding out the update is the usual stack of bug fixes and improvements. To install the update, open the Settings app and select General > Software Update. You can also grab the standalone version from our Downloads page and install via iTunes.
* Camera and Photos
* Maps
* Messages
* Apple Watch
* Other improvements and fixes
* iOS 10.1 is compatible with iPad 4 and above, iPhone 5 and above, and iPod Touch 6G.
