* The Lock screen is a great place to check the time, but if you want to add some personality to your time-telling, you might be interested in a new jailbreak tweak called TextyClock by iOS developer NeinZedd9.
* As shown in the example above, the tweak spells out the current time in English, rather than displaying a digital clock as you’re probably accustomed to by now.
* TextyClock works on both the Lock screen clock and on the Status Bar clock, so no matter where you are in iOS, you will see the text-based time indicator:

* TextyClock is fully customizable, so you’ll find a preference pane in the Settings app where you can personalize it to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* A respring doesn’t seem to be required to save your changes, but we did notice a slight delay before the changes took effect on their own.
* The idea isn’t entirely new, as other tweaks like Timely have done similar things in the past. On the other hand, TextyClock adopts a subtle approach, keeping a minimalist design that you can modify at your leisure.
* After trying the tweak for myself, I feel that the stock digital representation is a little better for day-to-day time glancing. TextyClock doesn’t make it impossible to tell the time throughout the day, but it takes longer to read a string of text and comprehend what you’ve just read than it does to simply look at some numbers.
* At the end of the day, the tweak is purely cosmetic; it won’t be for everyone, but it can add a stylish effect that some might enjoy more than the stock look and feel.
* If you’re interested in trying TextyClock, you can download it for $1.50 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 7, 8, 9, and 10 devices.
* Do you like the configurable text-based time indicator better than the stock digital clock? Share why or why not in the comments below!
