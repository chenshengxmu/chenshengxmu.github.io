* We’re still a few days away from the holiday weekend, but in an effort to get a head start, several retailers have launched what they are calling “early” or “pre-” Black Friday sales. We’re going to be covering as many of these deals as possible, with a particular focus on quality products and notable discounts. Here are a few we’ve found from Amazon thus far.
* Denon HEOS 1 HS2 Wireless Speaker – a premium Bluetooth speaker from Denon with a sharp design, high resolution audio support, seamless streaming from compatible apps, and more. Available for $99 (normal price $199). 
* New Kindle E-reader w/ Special Offers – Amazon’s entry level e-reader hits the gift sweet-spot of high-tech and affordability. The latest Kindle can hold thousands of e-books, has a battery that lasts for weeks and it comes in black and white. Available for $50 (normal price $80).
* GSM Lumia 640XL 5.7″ Windows Phone – I know, it’s Windows Phone. But if you’re looking for a cheap smartphone to give as a gift, or a cheap gadget for yourself, this is a great deal. It has a 5.7″ HD screen, 13MP camera and micro SD card slot. It’s an AT&T phone, but users have discovered a workaround to unlock it. Available for $70 (normal price $100).
* TP-Link Wi-Fi Tri-Band Gigabit Router – If a new router is on your list, this one is definitely worth looking at. It’s a tri-band router with 4-stream and NitroQAM technology that delivers blazing fast Wi-Fi speeds so you can do things like play online video games and stream 4K video with ease. Available for $200 (normal price $270).
* Logitech Circle Wi-Fi 2-Way Security Camera – this highly-rated security camera streams 1080p video to all of your devices, sets up in 60 seconds, and offers smart alerts. Its best trick, though, is it can be detached from its cable and moved anywhere in your home or office for up to 12 hours of wireless usage. Available for $130 (normal price $200).
* Yuneec Breeze Compact Smart 4K Drone – if you thought drones were a passing fad, think again. These remote control quadcopters are poised to be a hot item yet again this holiday season, and this is a particularly cool one from Yuneec. It’s very compact, has a 4K camera, is safe to fly indoors and easy to fly using almost any mobile device. Available for $397 (normal price $500).
* Anker Astro E1 5200mAh Portable Charger – this isn’t the $16 battery pack you see in the checkout line at Walmart. This is a #1 Best Seller on Amazon from noted accessory maker Anker. It features PowerIQ tech for speed and safety, enough power to fully charge an iPhone 7 at least 2 times, and an 18-month warranty. Available for $16 (normal price $50).
* Samsung 28″ UHD LED Monitor with FreeSync – true, you’re probably going to see a lot of displays under $300 this holiday season—maybe even under $100. But how many of them are going to be 28″ 4K panels with support for AMD’s FreeSync and a 4-star rating on Amazon? I’m guessing not many. Available for $300 (normal price $400).
* 13.3-inch Base MacBook Pro without Touch Bar – Amazon is matching BHPhoto’s pricing on the base model 13-inch MacBook Pro (2016) without Touch Bar, although it’s not quite as good of a deal since BHPhoto doesn’t charge you sales tax outside of NY. Still this is a nice discount on Apple’s latest laptop, and if you’re a Prime member shipping is quick and free. Available for $1,399 (normal price $1,499).
* Xbox One S 1TB Console – Battlefield 1 Bundle – this seems like it’s going to be the standard deal this holiday season, so it’s not necessarily unique to Amazon, but it’s still a good deal and the benefits for Prime members make this worth mentioning. This system supports 4K streaming, has 1TB of storage and comes with the special edition of the hit Battlefield 1. Available for $299 (normal price $350).
