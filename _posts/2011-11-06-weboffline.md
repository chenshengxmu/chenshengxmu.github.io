* WebOffline is a jailbreak tweak that allows you to save entire web pages for offline viewing in Safari. It’s tightly integrated with Apple’s stock iPhone browser, and makes offline reading fairly effortless.
* While there are other 3rd-party offline browsing solutions available, if you’re looking for the most native implementation you can come by, WebOffline may be worth a look…
* To use WebOffline, all you need to do is press the save button located in your toolbar or action-sheet to save for offline viewing. You can then go to Bookmarks > Saved Pages to access all of your saved pages, even when your device is devoid of 3G or Wi-Fi connectivity.
* WebOffline is one of the simplest native implementations of offline reading I’ve seen thus far, but it doesn’t come without a price. At $1.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, some may think it’s too pricey.
* I say if you’re always in situations where you’re lacking connectivity, you might consider WebOffline to be a sound investment.
* What do you think?
