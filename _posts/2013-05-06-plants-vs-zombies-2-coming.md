* Good news Plants vs. Zombies fans! Seattle-based game publisher PopCap revealed today that there is a sequel to the game in the works. The team released a video teaser earlier today, announcing that the highly-anticipated title will debut this summer.
* Although sought-after on all major consoles, Plants vs. Zombies has been particularly popular on iOS since it landed on the mobile platform in 2010. In fact, Apple says it ranks #12 for all-time paid iPhone apps. Now here, check out the teaser for version 2…
* Ok, so the clip doesn’t offer up much information about the gameplay in version 2, but it does provide us with a title and release date. It looks like PopCap’s hoping to deliver “Plants vs. Zombies 2: It’s About Time” to multiple gaming platforms by this July.
* So, who’s excited for Plants vs. Zombies 2?
