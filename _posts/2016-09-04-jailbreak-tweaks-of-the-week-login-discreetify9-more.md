* This has been a busy week for Cydia, at least for those who have jailbroken devices. In this roundup we’ll be showing you all of our favorite jailbreak tweaks we talked about this week, as well as all of the rest.
* Login is a stunning new Lock screen replacement that clearly has its roots firmly planted in the origins of OS X.
* As the screenshot shows, it basically turns your Lock screen into a an OS X-inspired login screen, complete with a password field, profile picture, and power buttons across the bottom. Everything is fully functional, so it works as good as it looks.
* This is one of those tweaks that you can tell right off the bat is made with love, so I would definitely recommend checking out our full review to see what this tweak is capable of.

* Never worry again about someone looking over your shoulder or someone picking up your device from the table while you’re not around to see what someone sent you in your latest notification with Discreetify9.
* With this tweak, you can selectively filter messages with specific keywords in the title text or content text and replace it with generic text or prevent the notification from even appearing at all.
* This tweak is your ultimate step to privacy without having to enable the system-wide content-hiding feature in iOS, because it can be fine-tuned to filter out only the messages you don’t want seen, all while unsuspectingly leaving those that aren’t privacy-intensive.
* You should definitely check out our full review on this one to learn more about how it works.
