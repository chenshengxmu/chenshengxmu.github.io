* If you go to Apple.com right now, you will be greeted with the image above. What can it be? Well, the rumors have been running around for a while that Apple is preparing a cloud version of iTunes which would allow you to stream your iTunes music from anywhere.
* Apple spent 1 billion dollars in a top-of-the-art data center so it’s about time they get some return on investment for this. But again, with Apple you never really know what to expect…
* The event will start at 7am PST, or 10am EST. What do you think Apple is going to unveil?
