* Reminders in iOS 5 is Apple’s kick in the teeth for all those To-Do apps that litter the App Store right now. A walk through the App Store will reveal more To-Do apps than you can shake a stick at, but Apple’s own Reminders app does pretty much everything you could ever need in iOS 5.
* There’s one Reminders feature that Apple hasn’t made a very good job of promoting. You can use iCloud to share and sync your reminders and tasks with other people…
* Using Reminders and iCloud, anyone can share their list of tasks with someone else. But that’s not the best part — the link works both ways, which means both parties can add, and check off tasks.
* To get this up and running, one of the two parties (me, for this example) shares their Reminders list from inside the Calendar web-app on iCloud.com. You need the recipient’s email address, and it doesn’t even have to be their iTunes or Apple ID, either.
* Party number two (Alex, for our oh-so-excellent example) then received an email and a link. Clicking, or indeed tapping if using an iPad, iPhone or iPod touch, takes him to an authentication screen where he then enters his real Apple ID. That’s it. Done.

* Fire up Reminders on a device running iOS 5 and wait for the syncing magic to happen. Soon enough, the shared list appears as if it was a local one. Adding new items to it, and indeed checking them off, is then synced both ways via iCloud. It’s awesome, and it’s basically undocumented.
