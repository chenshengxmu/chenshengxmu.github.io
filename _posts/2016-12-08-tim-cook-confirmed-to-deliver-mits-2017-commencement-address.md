* In the run-up to this coming summer, Apple’s boss Tim Cook will head to Cambridge to deliver his address at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Commencement exercises. Cook will address the Class of 2017 on Friday, June 9, the university announced today.
* Cook previously gave the commencement address for his Alma Mater Auburn University in 2011 and last year delivered the commencement address for GWU.
* MIT President L. Rafael Reif:
* Mr. Cook’s brilliance as a business leader, his genuineness as a human being and his passion for issues that matter to our community make his voice one that I know will resonate deeply with our graduates I am delighted that he will join us for Commencement and eagerly await his charge to the Class of 2017.
* And here’s Cook’s statement, in which he uses Jobs’s description of Apple standing at the intersection of liberal arts and advanced technology:
* Apple stands at the intersection of liberal arts and technology, and we’re proud to have many outstanding MIT graduates on our team. We believe deeply that technology can be a powerful force for good, and I’m looking forward to speaking to the Class of 2017 as they look ahead to making their own mark on the world.
* After joining Apple in 1998, Cook under Jobs’s leadership became its op-chief responsible for the company’s worldwide sales and operations, including management of Apple’s global supply chain, sales activities and service and support.
* He was named Apple CEO in 2011.
* “An advocate for equality and champion of the environment, Cook reminds audiences that Apple’s mission is to change the world for the better, both through its products and its policies,” MIT wrote.
* Cook’s predecessor, late Steve Jobs, delivered the praised commencement address in 2005 at Stanford in which he discussed death as “life’s changing agent”.
