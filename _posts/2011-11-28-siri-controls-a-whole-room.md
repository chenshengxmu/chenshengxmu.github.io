* We’re just going to right come out and say it: we’re pretty much in love with SiriProxy, and we’re not ashamed to admit it.
* Created by Pete “Plamoni” Lamonica, SiriProxy lets Siri interact with pretty much anything on a network, and people have done some pretty awesome things with it, ranging from opening car doors to launching apps on a Mac.
* As is so often the case with such hacks, the clever people of the internet have not stopped with new ways of using SiriProxy, and a new video just popped up on our radar that we think you’ll like, especially if you’ve ever been a fan of Star Trek…
* One of Star Trek’s most impressive pieces of future-tech was the all-knowing computer that was controlled by voice commands. Trekkers would ask the computer pretty much anything, or tell it to perform a task, and it was done. We marvelled, but we also knew that sooner or later our lives would imitate art. Today, that reality seems a little closer than it did yesterday.
* As the video shows, one intrepid coder has made Siri understand when he wants his curtains closing and his lights turning off. The system even understands the difference between two separate lights.
* This is just another example of what Siri could be made to do if Apple opened it up to developers, or even began building Siri into homes.
* OK, we’re getting a bit carried away now, we know!
* If you want to read about the man that made SiriProxy possible, be sure to check our exclusive interview with Pete “Plamoni” Lamonica, too.
