* Yahoo-owned Flickr is a great photography service – I’ve been using it for years as my default companion photo storage solution.
* It’s not just the fact that everyone gets a whopping one terabyte of free cloud storage for their photos, Flickr features a bunch of advanced options and keeps your photos backed up in the cloud in their full resolution.
* Flickr’s iOS app has been nice, albeit a bit rudimentary in terms of features. This changes with today’s release of an all-new Flickr version 3.0.
* Some of the many new features iPhone photography fans will surely fall in love with include the ability to record, edit and upload high-definition video, photo auto-tagging, comb through your photos using complex search criteria, access detailed photo data, share easily and quickly to Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook and lots more…
* Pictured top of post: the new HD video capture feature (left) and smarter search with auto-tagging (right). Note that video capture is limited to 30 seconds per clip.
* Here, check out a quick video walkthrough of Flickr 3.0.
* In addition to recording video in high-definition, Flickr 3.0 lets you edit your clips using the same fourteen non-destructive live filters available for photos and upload your work to the Flickr service, all from the palm of your hand.
* If you have hundreds or thousands of photos stored on Flickr or on your device, the smarter search feature with improved auto-tagging will help  you quickly find what you’re looking for, based on geography, time, image intelligence (including scenes and objects) and other criteria.

* “Flickr understands the geo-locations and time of your photos, can also detect the color, and often who’s in them and what they are about,” notes the team. “And we do all this with lightning fast speed”.
* You’re also going to love a redesigned navigation with batch organization of photos and a gorgeous new photostream (see below). 
* Simpler navigation and sharing (left) and detailed photo data (right).

* iPhone photography fans will be delighted to know that Flickr 3.0 now shows more image metadata than before: you can now finally check out when you took the photo, which camera and lens were used to create each shot and lots more.
* “Use the story behind the photo to help improve your own photography skills,” advises the team.
* To learn more about Flickr 3.0, check out the announcement blog post.
* Flickr is a free download in the App Store.
* Flickr debuted ten years ago and was the first major online community to store, organize, tag, and share digital photos. Again, each Flickr account gets 1TB of cloud storage, which is good for more than 500,000 photos. And yes, the app has an Auto Sync that uploads all your device photos to the cloud in their original quality so you don’t loose a pixel.
