* If you need another “proof” that the next MacBook Pro will indeed feature an OLED touch bar in place of the function key row, feel free to comb through system resources in the macOS Sierra 10.12.1 software update which released yesterday.
* As first discovered by MacRumors reader Gabriel Lorin, the System Preferences assets for the Mac’s virtual keyboard now come with refreshed image assets depicting an updated keyboard layout which no longer shows the standard row of function keys.
* In addition to the OLED touch bar that would display programmable shortcuts whose functions are thought to easily change from one app to another, the next MacBook Pro is expected to sport slimmer industrial design and be lighter than its predecessor.
* The notebook is said to pack in Intel’s SkyLake processors with faster graphics, USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports, Touch ID integrated into the Power button, the same low-profile keyboard with butterfly mechanism as on the new MacBook and more.

* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted both 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pro would get updated at Thursday’s event. He also called for a brand new 13-inch Mac notebook model that, however, could actually be a new version of the 13-inch MacBook Air with faster CPU/GPU and USB-C ports.

* A trademark application filed for on Apple’s behalf by a shell company suggests the Cupertino firm might choose to market the new OLED touch bar as “Magic Toolbar.”
* Bloomberg called the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh with the OLED touch bar the “most significant update in four years”.
