* Great news for folks who have built up a collection of Apple Watch bands and straps. Apple COO Jeff Williams just confirmed that they will all fit the new Series 4 models.
* While wrapping up the Apple Watch Series 4 section of this morning’s event, Williams noted that not only has Apple come up with new bands for the wearable, but that all previous Apple Watch straps would work for the new models. For a company that is routinely accused of nickel-and-diming their customers by killing off old accessories, this is a huge deal.
* Stay tuned for more announcements from today’s Gather Round event!
