* If you’re thinking about buying some gadgets in the Apple Online Store, you will have to wait until Apple’s ‘Hey Siri’ media event has wrapped up as the company’s webstore has just gone offline ahead of the press conference, which kicks off in San Francisco at 10am Pacific.
* In a long standing tradition, Apple takes its online stores down around the world ahead of major media events to both raise anticipation and prepare refreshed product pages.
* As you have probably heard by now, Apple is expected to hold a massive presentation today to introduce new iPhones, iPads and refresh its Apple TV set-top box.
* Rumors in the run-up to the event have pointed to an always-listening ‘Hey Siri’ functionality on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, likely with a little help from a dedicated voice activation chip to preserve battery life.
