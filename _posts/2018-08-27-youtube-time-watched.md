* Google-owned YouTube on Monday announced availability of a new set of digital wellbeing tools, Called Time Watched. Available through YouTube for iPhone and iPad, this new section lets you keep your YouTube time under control.
* It’s “dedicated to making sure that you have the information you need to better understand how you use YouTube and develop your own sense of digital wellbeing,” said YouTube.
* The most obvious use for the new feature would be helping YouTube fans keep their addiction under control by letting them know how much stuff they actually watch on YouTube. Available in the app’s account menu, this feature is akin to Apple’s Screen Time stats in iOS 12.

* You can see how long you’ve watched YouTube videos today, yesterday and over the past 7 days (excludes YouTube Music), see your daily average and adjust related features, such as disabling playing the next video automatically, all from one place.
* These stats include your YouTube activity across all devices. Other capabilities afforded by Time Watch include toggles for controlling the features Google introduced in May:
* Apple will debut its own Screen Time tools within iOS 12 later this fall.
