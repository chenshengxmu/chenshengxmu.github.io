* Apple on Tuesday posted a new iPhone 6s commercial, highlighting the hands-free capabilities of the just-released smartphone. The ad stars Bill Hader, the long-time Saturday Night Live actor who appeared in Apple’s “Backstage” video at WWDC this year.
* The spot demonstrates how users can tap Siri to read and respond to emails using voice commands, with a bit involving the well-known “foreign prince wants to help you get rich” scam. As you can imagine, it’s pretty entertaining. Watch the 30-second clip below.
