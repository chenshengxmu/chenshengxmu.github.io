* According to a new report by 9to5Mac, Apple’s upcoming iOS 9.2 software update will enable support for Arabic in Siri.
* With last year’s iOS 8 update, Apple has paved the way for Siri in Arabic with Arabic support for iOS’s Dictation and QuickType keyboard features.
* The full support for Arabic will allow local users not only to converse with Siri in Arabic but search for local places and businesses and more.
* 9to5Mac writer Mark Gurman speculated that implement Arabic support for Siri in iOS 9.2 might have something to do with a recent opening of a pair of flagship Apple Stores in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
* A video included below shows off a few examples of Siri in Arabic.
* The iOS 9.2 software update, currently in beta, will bring enhancements to Safari’s View Controller used to render webpages in third-party apps.
* Other new features in iOS 9.2, aside from bug fixes and optimizations, include support for AT&T’s NumberSync technology for Wi-Fi Calling on Macs with OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 (even when the iPhone is turned off) while possibly enabling support for the new American Express Apple Pay partnership for users in Canada and Australia.
