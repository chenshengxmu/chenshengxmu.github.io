* We’ve already shown you a beautiful iPhone 5 concept by Michal Bonikowski, and now another concept design of the iPhone 5 has caught our attention.
* Antoine Brieux from NAK Studio has created a gallery of renderings that he believes reflect Apple’s design evolution. We’ll leave you to draw your own conclusions on the design’s accuracy, but these designs are still mesmerizing to look at…
* The concept simplifies the iPhone’s design by giving it one body of metal edged off with two pieces of curved glass.

* It’s a pretty render, but it’s very unlikely that Apple’s next iPhone will look like this concept. All signs have been pointing towards an aluminum back for the iPhone 5, and we’ve seen other concepts that seem more Apple-ish.
* Nevertheless, great work, Antonie!
* What do you think? Do you like this concept?
