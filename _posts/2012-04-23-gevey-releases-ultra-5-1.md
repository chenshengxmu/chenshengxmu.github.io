* We’ve recently seen some great options surface for unlocking our iPhones. For instance, AT&T recently started unlocking off-contract handsets. And then of course there is the new SAM method that popped up over the weekend.
* But the competition hasn’t stopped GEVEY from releasing a new SIM interposer. In fact, it’s stepping up its game. The new Ultra 5.1 for the GSM iPhone 4 supports more basebands and has more features than ever before…
* As with previous interposers, the GEVEY Ultra 5.1 only works with jailbroken iPhones. And although Furious Mod will keep you from having to dial 112 after every reboot, we are assuming you still have to do so initially — which is illegal in some countries.
* Regardless, if you don’t qualify for AT&T’s unlocking terms, and you can’t get the SAM method to work, the GEVEY Ultra 5.1 appears to be a viable option. And if you’re interested, it looks like Applenberry has them in stock for just $49.99.
