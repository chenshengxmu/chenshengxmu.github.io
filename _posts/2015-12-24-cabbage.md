* A promising new jailbreak tweak called Cabbage is now available for download on the Cydia. Cabbage is a tweak that allows you to use 3D Touch to queue tracks for Up Next playback in the stock Music app. It takes an action that normally takes two gestures, and simplifies it down to a single 3D Touch gesture.

* Even if you don’t have a 3D Touch capable device like the iPhone 6s, you can still take advantage of Cabbage as the tweak has a built-in fake force touch gesture.
* Once you 3D Touch on a track inside the stock Music app, you’ll see a notification appear at the top of the status bar indicating that the gesture worked. It’s a simple, yet effective way of making it easier to queue up tracks inside the Music app.
* Cabbage features no preferences to configure, so once you install it, you can begin using it promptly.
* What do you think about using 3D Touch to add tracks to Up Next? Isn’t that a cool idea, or what?
