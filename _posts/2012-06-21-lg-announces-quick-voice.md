* Since it debuted back in 2007, the iPhone has become somewhat of a point of reference for other smartphones. It seems that every time a new handset is released, we hear: “is this the iPhone killer?”
* And it looks like the same thing has happened with Apple’s digital assistant. “Siri competitors” seems to be becoming a popular meme, as we’ve already seen one from Samsung, Google, and now LG…
* LG introduced “Quick Voice” yesterday, a digital assistant aimed squarely at the likes of Siri and S Voice. The feature will start arriving on a select few of the company’s devices later this month.
* According to BGR, the voice assistant will [initially] only have access to 11 applications. But will make up for that with the ability to search the web for things like weather and stock quotes.
* If nothing else, LG’s announcement confirms that Apple has done it again with Siri. Companies seem to be legitimately threatened by the feature, and are obviously devoting a significant amount of time and resources to produce their own solutions.
* But as with the iPad, Apple has jumped out to quite a lead in this space and it’s not looking back. The company recently announced its first major update for Siri, which will include several new features and in-car support from auto manufacturers.
* Will anyone be able to catch up?
