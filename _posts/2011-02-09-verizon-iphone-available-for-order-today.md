* Up until now, those wishing to hop on Big Red’s iPhone 4 train had to be existing customers. Back on February 3rd, those customers were able pre-order during an event that supposedly resulted in record sales figures.
* While we’re still a bit skeptical about the numbers, there’s no doubt that the prospect of having the iPhone on an alternative carrier in the States is an idea that the masses relish.
* Feeling left out? Fret not, because the Verizon iPhone 4 is now available for purchase, even if you aren’t an existing Verizon customer…
* Yes, even us non-special people can get our hands on a Verizon iPhone 4 starting today. If you head over to Verizon’s website, unsurprisingly that’s the first thing you’ll see.
* Now it’ll be interesting to sit back and watch how many iPhone users ditch their service with AT&T in favor of a network with a better reputation.

* I’m starting to get the feeling that people are realizing that the pastures might not be as green as they once thought.
* The whole idea of not being able to use data and voice at the same time is something that AT&T has been honed in on, and I think they are doing a good job of letting people know about the Verizon iPhone’s shortcomings.
* For those of you who are satisfied with their current digs, those of you in other countries, or for those of you that just don’t care, why not grab a box of popcorn and watch the hilarity ensure?
* After all, with these two involved, something downright funny is bound to happen one way or another.
* What will you be doing?
