* We’ve seen some useful custom widgets come out of the jailbreak community in the last few weeks- UISettings and StatusGoogle to name a few. But we’ve also seen some not-so-useful offerings, like ScreenLocker. Who needs another way to toggle the display’s lock orientation?
* Although some widgets might not be as useful to some as others, it’s still cool that they’re available. iOS 5 has only been out a month, so it’s just nice that developers are churning out tons of stuff for us to play with. That being said, here’s SlideCenter…
* This widget falls in the latter category of widgets that I mentioned above. There really isn’t a reason for it, but it’s cool that it’s there. Maybe some folks would appreciate a slide show of photos in their Notification Center pull-down menu, but I’ll pass.
* SlideCenter grabs photos from your camera roll and plays them in a slideshow in its widget space. Actually it can pull photos from both /var/Mobile/Media/DCIM/100Apple and var/Mobile/Media/Photo/Data/Sync folders. As of right now, there’s no way to customize the slideshow.
* As I said before, I’m not sure who would need a constant slideshow widget in their Notification Center. But for folks who want to check SlideCenter out, just make sure you have http://thebigboss.org/ios5beta/ in your Cydia source list and do a search for it.
* What do you think of SlideCenter?
