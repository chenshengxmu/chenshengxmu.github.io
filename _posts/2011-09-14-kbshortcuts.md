* What do you get when you mix ActionMenu, TextExpander, and Swype? It might end up in a disaster for those unskilled, but when rising jailbreak developer iSam is behind the project, people should take notice.
* His latest tweak, dubbed KBShortcuts, is a masterfully skilled mashup of all of those previously mentioned ideas, and it’s resulted in an absolute must have tweak — so much so, that It’ll leave you wondering how you ever got by without it…
* Interestingly, I have my own little personal back story with KBShortcuts. You see, iSam previously developed a tweak named Double At, a tweak that I reviewed a while back. While that tweak was very simple, I immediately saw promise in the concept. I saw a potential TextExpander-esque app for the iPhone; a real implementation, not the weaksauce App Store version.
* I asked iSam if he could flesh out Double At into something more, and then I didn’t hear from him for a while. Now, I know why…

* It’s because he was slaving away at developing a tweak that was leaps and bounds beyond my expectations. He took the best elements of Swype, TextExpander, and ActionMenu, and made it work within a single tweak.
* The result? It doesn’t just work, it excels. It makes me wonder how in the world I was ever able to do without it. It’s the same kind of feeling I had when I first tried ActionMenu on the iPhone, or TextExpander on the Mac. It’s something so simple, that I can’t believe it hasn’t been done until now. It has undo capabilities!
* Watch the video, and tell me if those same feelings don’t resonate with you. I dare you to tell me that those 30+ swipe commands, and 10 custom text expansion commands don’t have you excited.

* KBShortcuts is still in beta mode as of now, but judging by how polished the build I tested out was, it should be available shortly. The price will be $2.50 when it’s released, which is totally worth the added functionality that you gain.
* I’m anxious to hear what you guys think about this, and if you’re as excited about it as I am. Let me know in the comments below.
