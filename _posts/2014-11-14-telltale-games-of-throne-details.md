* Before revealing the first story details and premier trailer of “Tales from the Borderlands”, its upcoming adventure game based on on Gearbox and 2K’s Borderlands 2, Telltale yesterday offered a glimpse into an upcoming “Game of Thrones” game based on HBO’s award-winning fantasy drama television series, itself adapted from of “A Song of Ice and Fire”, George R. R. Martin’s series of fantasy novels.
* Filing as another episodic adventure game, the game follows the storyline of House Forrester detailed in the book “A Dance with Dragons,” the fifth book of the series, with an interesting twist: players will be permitted to assume the role of any of the five members of House Forrester in various locations around Westeros and Essos.
* Needless to say, your actions affect the rest of House Forrester. “Multiply the actions of one character by five, and you’re truly playing the Game of Thrones … where you win, or you die,” notes the blurb.
* Announced nearly a year ago, the coming game marks Telltale’s multi-year, multi-title partnership with HBO to create games based on the popular television series.
* Check out the teaser trailer below.
* Note: don’t confuse this game game with HBO’s existing Thrones Ascent game for the iPhone and iPad.
* The first episode is titled “Iron from Ice” and set between the events covered in the third and fourth season.
* Developers underscore that “the actions of one character can ripple out to affect the rest of House Forrester” while ensuring that players “will visit familiar locations such as King’s Landing and The Wall, as well as unfamiliar locations such as Ironrath, the home of House Forrester”
