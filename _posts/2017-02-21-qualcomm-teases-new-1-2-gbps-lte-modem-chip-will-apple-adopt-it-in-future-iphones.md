* Qualcomm and Apple are currently embroiled in a legal spat involving excessive royalties, casting serious doubt on the possibility of a Qualcomm-made LTE modem in a future iPhone. Today, Qualcomm teased a brand new Snapdragon X20 LTE chip, its second-gen Gigabit LTE modem.
* It’s capable of fiber-like LTE Category 18 downloads of up to 1.2 gigabits per second, or one-fifth faster than the previous X16 chip. Upload speeds go up to a theoretical maximum of 150 megabits per second. It’s expected to ship in the first half of 2018.
* Only time will tell if Apple plans on dual-sourcing cellular modems from both Qualcomm and Intel, in which case 2018 iPhones could theoretically support faster-than-Gigabit-LTE downlink speeds of up to 150 megabytes per second.
* Snapdragon X20 is built in a cutting-edge 10-nanometer FinFET process.
* It’s the world’s first-announced modem to support Cat 18 LTE and Qualcomm’s seventh-generation LTE multimode modem. The chip achieves up to 1.2 Gbps downloads by taking advantage of all-new carrier aggregation technology which uses twelve LTE spatial data streams data, each up to 100 megabits per second.
* The chip supports up to 5x carrier aggregation across licensed and unlicensed radio frequencies, as well as 4×4 MIMO on up to three aggregated carriers.
* Here are a few other perks provided by the X20:
* It also delivers crystal clear VoLTE calls on dual-SIM devices (a first for Snapdragon LTE modems) with support for ultra-fast LTE data speeds on either SIM. With current technologies, voice calls on the second SIM are not in Ultra HD audio resolution.
* The chip supports the 3.5-gigahertz band used by the Citizens Broadband Radio Service, which can be used to provide new services like private LTE-based networks.
* Qualcomm has started sampling the new modem to customers and is expecting first commercial X20 chips to begin shipping in the first half of 2018.

* What will Apple do?
* Rival Broadcom cannot supply LTE modems—the company exited that market last year as it was losing about $2 million a day in the modem business. Intel’s modem chips in iPhone 7, on the other hand, perform slower than their Qualcomm counterparts.
* Will 2018 iPhones support Qualcomm’s new LTE cellular technology, do you think?
