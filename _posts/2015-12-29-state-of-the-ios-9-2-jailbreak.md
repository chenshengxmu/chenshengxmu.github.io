* It’s been more than 2 months since Apple killed the iOS 9.0.x jailbreak, and in that time we’ve seen the public release of iOS 9.1, 9.2, and a beta version of 9.2.1, with no update to the Pangu tool. So as you can imagine, we’ve received a lot of questions regarding the current status of the jailbreak. Here is what we know so far.
* For a little context, Apple released iOS 9 on September 16. That was quickly followed by iOS 9.0.1 and 9.0.2 later in the month, with significant bug and security fixes. The iOS 9 jailbreak landed on October 13, courtesy of the talented Pangu Team, and it was compatible with all versions of iOS 9 we had seen up until that point.
* Pangu’s jailbreak tool was officially broken by Apple on October 21, with the release of iOS 9.1, which patched several security exploits used by the team of hackers. Thus, 9.0.2 is the latest version of iOS that’s eligible to be jailbroken, and Apple has long stopped signing the software, meaning you can’t up/downgrade to it.
* We’ve heard that both Pangu and TaiG are working on jailbreak tools for the latest public version of iOS, which is 9.2. In fact, a recent report pointed to a Weibo post by TaiG partner 3K Assistant which indicated their tool is nearly complete. Unfortunately, that’s all we’ve heard—we have no knowledge of an exact release date.
* What now? Now we sit and wait. The aforementioned teams aren’t much for status updates, and they have been extremely sporadic with recent releases. An iOS 9.2 jailbreak could literally come at anytime. So for those of you anxiously awaiting its arrival, be sure to stay tuned to iDB, because as soon as we know more, you’ll know.
* It really depends on your situation. Obviously, if you are on iOS 9.0.x and are either enjoying a jailbreak or still considering it, you should stay put. If you’re on iOS 9.1, that’s a tougher call, because although it’s extremely unlikely we’ll see an iOS 9.1-only jailbreak, it’s possible. For what it’s worth, if I were on 9.1, I would update.
