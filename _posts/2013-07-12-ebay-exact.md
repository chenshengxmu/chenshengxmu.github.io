* The online auctioning giant eBay on Friday launched a brand new iPhone application called eBay Exact, designed to let customers buy customizable 3D-printed merchandise on the go.
* 3D printing with eBay (a first for the firm) is as easy as selecting a product, choosing from a variety of materials (including plastics, wood and metals) and designs and using customized engraving to add your own personal flare to create a unique item.
* eBay partnered with 3D printing leaders such as France-based Sculpteo, Brooklyn-based Makerbot and Canada-based Hot Pop Factory on a cherry-picked selection of products that include iPhone cases, figurines and jewelry…
* From iTunes release notes:
* · Bring your style to life. Choose from a variety of materials, including plastics, wood and metals. Use the engraving feature to further customize your product. · Be the first to use new technology to create one-of-a-kind iPhone cases, jewelry, and figurines based on self-portraits. · Build your collection. Whether you love jewelry or figurines, eBay Exact allows you to create as many unique products, exactly as you like, based on your personal desires and preferences.
* According to eBay’s blog post, items cost anywhere from $9 for a plastic iPhone case to $350 for a metal ring (yes, they accept PayPal) and are shipped directly from each 3D printer’s facilities.
* “Buyers who choose to buy from Sculpteo can play around with a 360-degree preview image of the item they want to customize and buy,” eBay noted.
* Here is a sample 3D-printed iPhone case and jewelry.
