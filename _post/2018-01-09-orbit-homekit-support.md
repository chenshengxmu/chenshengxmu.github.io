* Here at CES 2018, Orbit announced that HomeKit support will be coming to their line of irrigation products, which encompasses smart sprinklers and other accessories.
* Both the B-hyve Wi-Fi Smart Sprinkler Timer and B-hyve Smart Hose Faucet Timer will support HomeKit, Siri, scenes, triggers and other automation. While the B-hyve smart sprinkler has been on the market already, the Smart Hose Faucet Timer is a new product unveiled at CES.

* By being able to control the faucet, it gives you the ability to schedule and automate your watering whether through your own sprinklers or an installed soaker system.
* The new Wi-Fi hub and faucet timer will be available starting in January, priced at $69.99.
