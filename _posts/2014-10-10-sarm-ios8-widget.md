* Swarm, a dedicated check-in app by Foursquare, has received a tremendously useful update Friday which makes it dead simple to check in to your favorite locations right from your Lock screen without even opening the app, thanks to a brand new Notification Center widget available on iOS 8 devices.
* The Swarm widget in the 1.3 update also gives you an at-a-glance view of a few of your friends who are especially close, helping you get a sense of who’s around.
* To enable the widget, simply swipe down on the Lock or Home screen to bring up the Notification Center. Now swipe to your Today view, hit the Edit button halfway down and enable the Swarm widget.
* Now you can check in with a single tap.

* This update also includes a few bug fixes and speed increases.
* Swarm for the iPhone and iPod touch, a 14.4-megabyte download, is available free in the App Store. The app requires iO 7.0 or later (iOS 8 is required for widget functionality).
