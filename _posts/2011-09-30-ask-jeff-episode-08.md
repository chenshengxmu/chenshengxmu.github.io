* How do you plan on preparing for the next iPhone? Whether it’s the iPhone 5, or the iPhone 4S, a lot of folks have different gameplans when it comes to acquiring the next iPhone.
* What will you do with your current iPhone? Will you downgrade the firmware, jailbreak and unlock it, and try to pull in a premium? Or will you do like me, and keep your old iPhone and use it as a testing device?
* These, and many, many more questions are answered in this week’s episode of Ask Jeff…
* In this week’s episode, I cover the next iPhone, downgrading to iOS 4.3.3, and how I got into making YouTube videos in the first place.
* If your question didn’t make this week’s agenda, I’m sorry, but why not shoot for next week? Be sure to submit your question or comment below.
* What did you think about Episode 08?
