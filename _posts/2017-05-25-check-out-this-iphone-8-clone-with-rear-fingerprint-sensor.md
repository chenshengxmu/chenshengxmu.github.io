* The images of an iPhone 8 clone that hit the web yesterday give us a good indication what an iPhone 8 with a rear-mounted Touch ID sensor might look like. According to Benjamin Geskin, who tweeted out the rendered images, the device is based on an early iPhone 8 prototype.
* The images were originally posted on Chinese social media platform Weibo. “All my sources said that this is totally wrong design,” Geskin cautioned, adding that iPhone 8 “is not going to look like that.”
* The phone sports a slim bezels on the front face with no physical Home button.
* On the back, we can clearly see a vertically stacked dual-lens camera and a Touch ID-like sensor, positioned below the Apple logo. The copycat device features an aluminum chassis.
* iPhone 8, as you know, is said to feature a glass sandwich design in order to avoid any potential interference with its wireless charging components.
* The placement of the fingerprint sensor on China’s iPhone 8 clone actually makes sense to me: it’s relatively easily reachable with one’s index finger, as opposed to Galaxy S8’s fingerprint sensor positioned next to the rear camera.
* Some reports have suggested that one of the more than ten iPhone prototypes Apple has been testing has a rear Touch ID. Newer reports, however, have indicated that Apple has managed to integrate Touch ID into the display assembly after all.
* Still, the company was smart enough to engineer an iPhone with a rear Touch ID as a fallback device, just in case.
* To me, the biggest takeaway from looking at these renderings is that iPhones would look much better with some additional color options beyond the usual black, silver and gold choices.
