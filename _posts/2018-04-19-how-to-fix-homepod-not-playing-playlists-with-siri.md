* The Apple HomePod is one of the most intriguing products to come from Cupertino in some time. In fact, it seems that the HomePod is almost like a new version of the iPod Hi-fi which launched quite a long time ago.
* Unfortunately, the HomePod has been seeing quite a few different issues as of late. One of these issues is being able to ask Siri to play specific playlists or artists.
* Some users have found that Siri will act as though it has no idea what you’re talking about. Others have stated Siri states “Cannot find playlist XXX in your music”.
* We’re going to take a look at a few different ways for you to fix this issue.
* The first “fix” here may be most obvious of the bunch. It seems that Apple has made it possible for you to use Siri on your iPhone or iPad to play specific playlists with Apple Music.
* However, there’s a hangup for those who are not subscribed to Apple Music in order to play playlists properly. This is due to the inclusion of iCloud Music Library, which must be active.

* Apple does not explicitly state that you must have an Apple Music subscription. Nonetheless, signing up for Apple Music may help alleviate any issues you run into.
* If you are a new subscriber, chances are that you can get a three-month subscription for free. From there, you will be charged $9.99 per month, which is well worth the cost if you plan to keep using your HomePod.
* The next option here is a pretty basic method to try to get things working. This method requires you to remove and re-add the HomePod to your iCloud.
* In order to remove the HomePod from your iCloud, you’ll need to follow these steps:
* This will remove the HomePod from your iCloud account entirely. From there, you can go through and set up the HomePod as if you’re opening it for the first time again.
* When you remove the HomePod from your iCloud account, this effectively resets the speaker. However, there is another method for resetting the HomePod without fiddling with Apple’s Home app.

* If you want to reset the HomePod from the speaker itself, follow these steps:
* As was the case with the last method, this will reset your HomePod to factory settings. This means that you will be able to set up the HomePod as though it’s brand new.
* Since the root of the problem here is that Siri is not acting correctly, there’s a chance that there’s a hang-up somewhere. This is where disabling the ‘Hey Siri’ command could come in handy.
* In order to do so, there are two different methods. The first is simply by using your voice and stating “Hey Siri, disable Hey Siri”. This may seem counterintuitive, but it should still work without issue.
* The next method requires the use of the Home app on your iPhone or iPad. Simply open the app, tap and hold on your HomePod to view the Details panel. Then you will want to toggle ‘Hey Siri” from this menu.
* It’s rather unfortunate that Apple has yet to respond to the various issues that have arisen with the HomePod. But it also comes as no surprise considering that new updates are constantly being released.
* In the meantime, if you have run into this issue with your HomePod and found a fix we didn’t mention let us know. Additionally, be sure to sound off in the comments and let us know how you are liking the HomePod so far!
