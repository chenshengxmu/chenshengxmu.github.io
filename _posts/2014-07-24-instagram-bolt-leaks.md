* Facebook-owned Instagram may have unintentionally (or intentionally, perhaps?) leaked an image advertising its rumored Snapchat competitor, indicating the official launch could as well be around the corner. A banner for an app called Bolt was spotted by several online users in Instagram’s Android app.
* Tapping the banner would yield a dead end in the Google Play Store. Although the banner went away a few minutes later, people have already screenshoted it and the image is now making rounds on Twitter and other social media channels online…
* The banner advertises an app called Bolt, billed as a “one-tap photo messaging” solution. Given that Snapchat currently rules the ephemeral photo messaging space, it’s easy to see who Instagram has in its crosshairs with Bolt.
* Also: Instagram rules the photo-sharing market so building the photo-messaging functionality on top of its mobile photography expertise could yield killer results.
* Facebook, like many other companies, frequently tests unreleased features before they launch and sometimes slip-ups like this happen. For instance, Facebook’s ephemeral messaging app called Slingshot briefly appeared on the App Store before its official debut a week later.
* I’ve reached out to both Facebook and Instagram and will update if they respond with a comment.
* What do you guys make of this?
* Do you think Instagram’s Bolt can take on the likes of Snapchat?
