* At an emergency conference about the iPhone 4 antenna issue, Steve Jobs announced today that the White iPhone 4 will start shipping at the end of July in limited quantities.
* Apple previously said the White iPhone would be available mid July. Even though the sales numbers are impressive, I think the iPhone 4 launch has been disastrous and very sloppy.
