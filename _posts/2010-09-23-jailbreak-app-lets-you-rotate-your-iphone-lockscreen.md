* LSRotator is a new jailbreak app in Cydia that lets you rotate your iPhone lockscreen. Just like it works on your iPad, this tweak lets your iPhone lockscreen rotate according to your device orientation.
* If you liked SBRotator, then this app will be a nice addition and will let you use your iPhone in landscape mode on the lockscreen too…
* According to the app description, you can lock the orientation by simply tapping the lockscreen with 2 fingers. Rotation duration, orientation angles and graphical options are available under settings.
* LSRotator supports Cydgets, CyDialer, LockInfo, ClockHide, SmartScreen and several other addons.
* It’s available in Cydia for $0.99. I can’t see myself using this app. Can you?
