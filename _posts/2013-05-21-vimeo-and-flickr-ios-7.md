* Details regarding iOS 7 are still fairly scarce, despite the fact that WWDC is just a few weeks away. Apple has said that it will be previewing its next-generation mobile operating system at its annual developer conference next month.
* We do know a few things though. Most of the rumors suggest iOS 7 will feature a UI overhaul, in favor of a much flatter design. And according to a new report, Apple will also be beefing up social ties with Vimeo and Flickr integration…
* 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman reports:
* “In the upcoming overhaul of its iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch operating system, iOS 7, Apple plans to include an increased presence of third-party social networks, including Flickr and Vimeo, according to a person familiar with the software.”
* Gurman is quick to mention that because the software has yet to be officially announced, there is a possibility that any feature in testing could be removed prior to unveiling. Should it make it into the release though, this is how it will work:
* “Both Flickr and Vimeo will now also be integrated deeply into the new operating system, so users will be able to sign into the respective networks via iOS 7′s built-in Settings application. Like with iOS’s Facebook and Twitter ties, Apple customers will be able to log-in one time into each social network and have full sharing access.”
* Just like in OS X, iOS 7 users will have the ability to share photos stored on, or taken with, their devices to Flickr with a single tap. It’s also likely that the new integration will allow for instant log-in to the photo service from within third party apps.
* As for Vimeo integration, which is also already in OS X, it will give users a new system-wide video sharing option. The report doesn’t offer many details beyond that, but it’s not surprising to hear Apple wants to offer users an alternative to YouTube.
* It’ll be interesting to see what other changes Apple has made in iOS 7—last year, the company proudly touted that iOS 6 had more than 200 new features and improvements from its predecessor. I guess we’ll see soon enough, WWDC starts June 10.
