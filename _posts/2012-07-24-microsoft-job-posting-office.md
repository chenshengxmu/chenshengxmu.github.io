* Microsoft recently announced the latest version of its popular Office suite, Office 2013. And while there was no mention of whether or not the software would make it to iOS, the tech world seems pretty convinced it’s coming.
* A recently discovered job listing on Microsoft’s website adds fuel to the fire, as it calls for a new software development engineer for the company’s Office division to “be part of Microsoft’s next move on the Mac and on iOS…”
* The posting reads:
* Job Category: Software Engineering: Test
* Location: Mountain View, CA, US
* Job ID: 791567-79632
* Division: Microsoft Office Division
* The MacBU Group at the Silicon Valley Campus is looking for a talented Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) with a strong technical background to join the Outlook Test team. YOu will work very closely with the Development team on the design, implementation, & testing of new feature work to be part of Microsoft’s next move on the Mac and on iOS.
* As 9to5Mac points out, this doesn’t necessarily prove that Office is going to be coming to iOS anytime soon. Microsoft does have a number of apps in the App Store, so it’s possible that Outlook is just next on the list.
* That would jibe with a previous report which claimed that Outlook and Lync would be making their way to Apple’s mobile platform this fall. Perhaps Microsoft plans on releasing Office apps for iOS, one or two at a time.
* What do you think? Would you use Outlook in iOS?
