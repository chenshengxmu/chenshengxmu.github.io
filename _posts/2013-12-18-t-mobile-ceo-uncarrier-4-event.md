* Get ready US carriers and subscribers, it looks like T-Mobile is about to introduce another game-changer. The company’s outspoken CEO John Legere tweeted out this morning that it’s time for them to ‘eliminate another customer paint point.’
* He followed the comment by teasing ‘Uncarrier4,’ which is believed to be an upcoming media event T-Mobile is planning to make some sort of announcement. In the past, the carrier has held ‘Uncarrier’ events to unveil things like its Jump plan…
* Here’s the tweet:
* #ItsAboutCustomers -Time to eliminate another customer pain point? Time for #Uncarrier4? Yes it’s time! Stay tuned…Happy New Year #Randall
* — John Legere (@JohnLegere) December 18, 2013
* Notice the ‘Randall’ hashtag—that’s a not-so-subtle poke at AT&T’s CEO Randall Stephenson. The executive made some controversial remarks last week regarding device subsidies, and Legere has had a one-sided Twitter battle going on with him.
* But back to the event. The tweet doesn’t offer up any kind of timeframe for Uncarrier 4, but we’re guessing that with Christmas just a week away, it’ll happen sometime in early 2014. In fact CES, which is coming up on January 6, would be perfect timing.
* Again, in the past T-Mobile has used these kinds of events to announce industry-shaking moves like its plan to do away with contracts and device subsidies, and its T-Mobile Jump upgrade plan. The carrier is also reportedly being courted by Sprint.
* Stay tuned.
