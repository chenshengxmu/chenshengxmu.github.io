* George Hotz aka ”Geohot”, one of the pioneers of the early jailbreak scene, is building a self-driving car of its own, according to a lengthy profile published today by Bloomberg Businessweek.
* If you frequent this website, you’re probably aware that Hotz is credited with becoming the first person to carrier-unlock an iPhone, which allowed users to use their handset with other carriers.
* Much like he’d hacked the original iPhone, he’s now done the same with his ordinary 2016 Acura ILX sedan. Working in his garage, he’s managed to turn the Acura into a self-driving vehicle in about a month, by putting a laser-based radar on the roof, mounting a camera near the rearview mirror and attaching a 21.5-inch screen and a joystick to the dashboard.
* “We’re on the brink of another industrial revolution now,” he said. “The entire Internet at the moment has about 10 brains’ worth of computing power, but that won’t always be the case.”
* In outfitting the Acura with cameras and sensors, he’s written his own software that runs on a Linux-based machine. The software is trained for the cameras using so-called neural net, a self-teaching artificial intelligence that uses data from the vehicle and driver to learn from their choices.
* The self-learning system that doesn’t rely on preprogrammed rules about driving, like pretty much all commercially available self-driving systems on the market do. In order to rack up a lot of training miles for the car, Hotz intends to start driving for Uber soon.

* Intriguingly enough, his feat is said to have impressed Tesla Motors founder and co-owner Elon Musk so much that he offered Hotz a job working on homegrown Autopilot software along with a multimillion-dollar bonus.
* “I’m happy to work out a multimillion-dollar bonus with a longer time horizon that pays out as soon as we discontinue Mobileye,” Musk is said to have emailed.
* Hotz declined.
* “I’m a big Elon fan, but I wish he didn’t jerk me around for three months,” he says. “He can buy the technology for double.”
* In a few months time, Hotz claims he will have a video of his Acura outperforming a Tesla across the Golden Gate Bridge (“he’s heard that Teslas struggle when going across the bridge because of the poor lane markings”) before passing the final test on I-405 in Los Angeles, where Musk lives.
* So, what does the future hold for Hotz?
* With comma.ai, his own company, Hotz has Mobileye in its sights, a supplier of driving assistance systems that helps power Tesla’s Autopilot system. Using off-the-shelf parts, he’s basically building a $1,000 kit consisting of six cameras and smart control software that automakers would hopefully sell directly to consumers who would buy customized vehicles at a showroom run by Hotz.
* Speaking of future, here’s a passage that I’ve found worthy of sharing:
* The truth is that work as we know it in its modern form has not been around that long, and I kind of want to use AI to abolish it. I want to take everyone’s jobs. Most people would be happy with that, especially the ones who don’t like their jobs.
* Let’s free them of mental tedium and push that to machines. In the next 10 years, you’ll see a big segment of the human labor force fall away. In 25 years, AI will be able to do almost everything a human can do. The last people with jobs will be AI programmers.
