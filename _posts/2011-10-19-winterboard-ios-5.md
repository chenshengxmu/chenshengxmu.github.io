* WinterBoard, the jailbreak application that allows you to customize virtually every design aspect of your iPhone, has been updated with support for iOS 5.
* After a week or so of beta testing, saurik has finally worked out all the kinks and made sure that WinterBoard is fully compatible and stable when running on iOS 5…
* Because it is updated for iOS 5, it doesn’t mean that all themes will work. Themes also have to be updated to work properly on iOS 5. So if you have a theme that’s not working right, it’s probably not because of WinterBoard, but because of the theme itself.
* You can easily update WinterBoard directly from Cydia. You know the drill.
* How is this updated version of WinterBoard working for you?
