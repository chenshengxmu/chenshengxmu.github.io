* Smart Covers are awesome! If you own an iPad 2 then you just absolutely, positively must own a Smart Cover. It’s a stand. It’s a cover. It’s smart. What’s not to like?
* We’re not really sure why Apple hasn’t made a similar accessory for the iPhone, but there is a new Kickstarter project that’s proposing an iPhone-optimized Smart Cover with a unique twist.
* In fact, the TidyTilt even has one or two tricks up its sleeve. Tricks that mean the project has already met its modest $10,000 goal, raising $47,000 to date.
* What exactly is the TidyTilt? In the words of the project’s owners:
* “… is an earbud cord wrap, multi-position kickstand, and mount for iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. TidyTilt takes up less space than any one of these devices – yet does all three things – without adding something extra to carry.”
* The addition of the earbud holding capability gives the TidyTilt a feature the official iPad 2 Smart Cover does not boast. And as the promotional video shows, anything that keeps our cables tidy is a good thing!
* The cover itself attaches to the iPhone’s rear panel using a magnetic frame that adds minimal size to the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. You also have the added benefit of meaning of mounting your iPhone on any magnetic surface. Genius!

* We’d prefer the TidyTilt more if it was on the front of the iPhone, but we understand the design implications of doing that. Still, this thing looks super cool!
