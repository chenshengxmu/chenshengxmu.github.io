* If you’ve gone through the trouble of jailbreaking your iPhone or iPad and are perusing for a fun and quirky way to customize it, then look no further than a new free jailbreak tweak called YouRespring by iOS developer Dev4i.
* YouRespring lets you give your handset’s respring screen a fresh coat of paint. It replaces the traditional black screen with the central white spinner you see above with any animated GIF that you might fancy having as your respring screen.
* After installing YouSpring, you can visit the tweak’s preference pane in the Settings app to configure it to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* You’ll notice the large GIF preview box at the top of the preference pane; this lets you see your changes in real-time without respringing your device. What you see here reflects what you should expect to see every time you respring.
* …And just in case you were wondering, the developer includes a convenient respring button at the bottom of the preference pane that lets you save your changes on demand.
* To get the best results out of YouRespring, we recommend finding an animated GIF with a transparent background so that the tweak’s background color feature blends seamlessly with it. That said, spend a little time looking for the ideal GIF image, or else you may end up disappointed with the result.
* On the other hand, if you’re looking for something a little less in-depth, then you might be interested in alternative respring screen-modifying tweaks like MakeRespringsGreatAgain and SpringChanger.
* If you’re interested in trying YouRespring for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works with jailbroken iOS 10 and 11 devices.
* What will you be configuring as your custom respring screen upon installing YouRespring? Let us know in the comments section below.
