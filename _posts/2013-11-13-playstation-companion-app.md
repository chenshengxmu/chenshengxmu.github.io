* Ahead of its big PlayStation 4 launch later this week, Sony has released a new companion app for the console, aptly named ‘PlayStation App.’ Sony says that the app will allow you to “take your PlayStation experience with you on your mobile device.”
* Part of that experience includes the ability to connect to the PSN network, meaning you’ll be able to chat with your friends, see what they’re playing, and open game alerts and invites. You’ll also be able to browse the PlayStation store, and much more…
* From the App Store description:
* Take your PlayStation® experience with you on your mobile device with the new PlayStation®App! Always be ready to game with features that keep you connected to your gaming friends and the games you love to play. Push games from PlayStation®Store to your PS4™ system and be ready to game at home.
* And here’s a breakdown of some of the more notable features:
* – See what your friends are playing, compare trophies, and view your profile or recent activity. – Chat with your friends; receive notifications, game alerts, and invitations, and then use your mobile device as an on-screen keyboard for your PS4™ system. – Browse PlayStation®Store, pick-up the latest hit games and add-ons, and then push them to your PS4™ system so they are ready when you get home. – Take advantage of the in-app second-screen features, when available, for greater challenges and control. – Quickly access PlayStation® system guides, manuals, and PlayStation.Blog.
* Using the app as a second screen for compatible games sounds intriguing. In the press release, Sony gives the example using the pre-installed game The Playroom, which allows users to draw pictures on their mobile devices and then flick them towards the TV.

* Sony adds that users will also be able to use the app as a remote control for their PS4 consoles, to use while navigating through menus or watching video content. And if a friend uploads gameplay footage, users will be able to watch it and even leave comments.
* Of course, you’ll need a PlayStation 4 console and a Sony Network account for any of these features to work. But for those who meet those requirements come Friday, grabbing this app seems like a no-brainer. PlayStation App is available in the App Store for free.
