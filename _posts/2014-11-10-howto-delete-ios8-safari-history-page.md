* Have you ever “accidentally” visited a site on your iPhone only to immediately delete your entire history because you originally didn’t want to leave traces of your activity?
* That’s exactly what has happened to me the other day and boy did I regret wiping my whole Safari history clean just because of one stupid page.
* I assumed that iOS didn’t allow for removing individual pages from browsing history.
* Having done my research since, I now know better. Yes, it is in fact possible to remove a page, any previously visited page, from your browsing history in Safari on both iOS and Mac. It couldn’t be simpler, let me show you how.
* Step 1: Fire up Safari on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad and tap the bookmark icon in the bottom right corner (the one resembling an open book).
* Step 2: Choose History from your Bookmarks.
* Step 3: Scroll through the list to find the previously visited page you’d like to remove, swipe left over it and select Delete.
* I indulged my curiosity by checking out an article at Business Insider dealing with the Alex from Target phenomenon, It’s kinda embarrassing so I want it removed in order to avoid my nephew, who knows where to look, finding about this in my Safari history.
* I’m just going to delete this entry.

* Step 4: When finished removing specific pages from your history, tap the Done button.
* Step 1: Fire up Safari on your OS X Mac and choose Show History in Safari’s History menu, or press Alt-⌘-2.

* Step 2: Find the previously visited page you’d like to remove, hold down the Control key while pressing the left mouse button and choose Delete from the contextual drop-down menu. You can also right click on an entry and select Delete.

* Tip: You can also select the entry and hit the Backspace key on your keyboard. Strangely enough, you cannot delete multiple pages from Safari’s history at once.
* Keep in mind that with iOS and OS X, iCloud now keeps your browser history synced across Mac and iOS devices that are linked to the same iCloud account, in addition to your bookmarks, open tabs and Reading List items like before.
* As a result, deleting a webpage on one device removes it automatically from Safari history on all your other devices. It’s a great time saver and precisely what most people will want to do anyway. Should you, however, prefer to have separate web browsing history on each device, consider disabling Safari sync in Settings > iCloud.

* Removing cherry-picked items from your Safari history on iOS and Mac is a sure-fire solution for the problem of unwanted history items surfacing in Safari’s suggestions in the search/URL bar.
* Privacy-minded parents who share devices with their kids will be happy learning they can take steps to ensure any webpage doesn’t show up in their browsing history.
* Or maybe you were just skimming through online shopping sites in search for the perfect holiday present for your significant other. In that case — unless you were shopping for presents in Safari’s private browsing mode — you don’t want your spouse to inadvertently spoil the surprise by stumbling upon your gift ideas in your browsing history.
* Speaking of Safari, Yosemite has introduced a change meant to promote a clean looking Search bar in Safari by hiding a portion of the URL after the the domain name and TLD (e.g. idownloadblog.com).
* If this has been ticking you off, follow Jeff’s quick tutorial that will teach you how to get the full website address back into the Search bar in Safari for Mac. Oh, and there’s a new jailbreak tweak in town which lets you disable frequently visited sites in Safari.
* Signing off, is your iOS device running low on storage? Are you using Safari’s Reading List heavily? You may want to clear the Reading List cache to free up considerable amount of space.
