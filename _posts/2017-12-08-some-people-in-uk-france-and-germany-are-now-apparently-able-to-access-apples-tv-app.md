* According to social media reports Friday, some users in the United Kingdom, France and Germany are now seeing Apple’s TV app on their iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV.
* The app is currently available in the United Starts, Canada (English, French), Australia, Norway and Sweden, according to Apple’s iOS Feature Availability webpage.
* As first noted by MacRumors this morning, it began showing up for some fourth and fifth-generation Apple TV owners in the United Kingdom, France and Germany.
* Apple’s webpage didn’t reflect any new countries at post time, suggesting the company may have just begun a staggered rollout of this app in the UK, Germany and France.
* Introduced at the October 2016 “Hello again” Mac event, the app made its debut the following month with the release of iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1. Apple said it would completely change how you watch TV, but it took some time for them to sign up a decent number of content providers.

* Designed as a television guide of sorts, the TV app makes it easy to find and discover content from compatible video apps (with the notable exception of Netflix). In the United States, more than 60 video-streaming apps expose their content in the TV app. In other markets, the app works with local streaming services, like BBC iPlayer in the UK.
* It supports the Single Sign-On feature for easy logging with existing cable credentials and works great across devices: if you stop watching a movie or show halfway through, you can pick it up later on a different device via the Up Next feature, and vice versa.
* Meet Apple TV App. Everything you watch. All in one place. And now @PrimeVideo is here. On your iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.https://t.co/t8HrwrXyqT pic.twitter.com/RRWdHDJT0L

* It comes with the Siri Live Tune In feature and brings your iTunes purchases, assorted subscription services and a wide variety of free content in one central place, with cherry-picked recommendations via the What to Watch section tailored to your watch history.

* As of recently, the app began serving live events, starting with live sporting events.
* Apple has also said that the TV app will also gain a new section dedicated to live news content. In another move indicating that it’s doubling-down on this app, Apple earlier this week transformed its official iTunes Movies account on Twitter into @AppleTV.
