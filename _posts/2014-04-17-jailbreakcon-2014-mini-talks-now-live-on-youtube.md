* This year’s edition of JailbreakCon saw the introduction of mini talks, short presentations by various actors of the jailbreak community on different topics. Talks were between 5 and 20 minutes and were the occasion for speakers to share some of their knowledge with the audience, without necessarily taking up a whole lot of time.
* I was actually one of the mini talk speakers. I actually believe that I went way over the 15 minutes I was allotted. Check inside for all videos of all the mini talks…
