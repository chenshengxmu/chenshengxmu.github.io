title: How to Remove the GreenPois0n Animated Boot Logo
---
* When it was released a little over a week ago, the GreenPois0n jailbreak for iOS 4.2.1 came with a nice surprise: animated boot logos. We already saw how to add an animated boot logo to your iPhone, and today, we’re going to see how to remove this custom logo.

* This is a fairly easy process which will require about a minute of your time, depending on how fast Cydia loads for you at the moment…
* This will bring back the stock Apple logo. If you ever want to go back to the GreenPois0n boot logo, you can always do so by following the steps above and selecting “Chronic Dev” instead.
* And remember that there are now dozens of animated boot logos available on Cydia. You might find the perfect one for you there by doing a simple search.
