* A pair of new flyover videos from YouTubers Duncan Sinfield and Matthew Roberts reveal that Apple has installed exterior lights at Apple Campus 2 site, showing the iSpaceship building facade glowing at night. It’s quite a spectacular sight given the enormous scale of the flying saucer-shaped structure.
* Apple Campus 2, as it’s officially called, will become home to more than 12,000 employees when it’s completed some time in early 2017.
* Duncan’s 4K video, shot using the DJI Inspire 1 Pro, reveals that a lot has changed at the iSpaceship site in the last 30 days as we’re now seeing significant landscaping development and finishing touches on the ring-shaped building itself.
* The voiceover in the video is an excerpt from Jony Ive’s tribute speech to Steve Jobs at Apple’s October 2011 memorial service held at its Cupertino headquarters. To give you a better feel for the massive scale of the building, here’s ground-level footage of iSpaceship captured by The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple.
* “This past weekend, I had the chance to swing by the Apple Campus 2 construction site. I took a quick bit of footage from one of the side roads,” Dalrymple wrote. “I think it gives a real sense of just how big the main building really is. The drone flyovers give a sense of relative scale, but up close the building feels massive.”
* The flyover clip from Matthew Roberts can be seen below.
* These clips prove that Apple has made a lot of progress on planting trees while landscaping work continues around the green areas and the courtyard’s gardens inside and around the structure.
* About 40 percent of solar panels have thus far been installed on the building’s roof.
