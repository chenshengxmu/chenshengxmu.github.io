* With the imminent Verizon iPhone announcement, what better way to pass the time than seeing what you would actually be gaining with a Verizon iPhone. People want better cellular coverage, data reliability and overall speed. AT&T hasn’t built a very good reputation over its last 3+ years of exclusivity with the iPhone.
* The general consensus in the U.S. is that a Verizon iPhone would probably make the revolutionary smartphone a much more dependable cellphone. Less dropped calls and 3G dead-zones would be a warm welcome to those plagued by AT&T sluggishness in heavily populated areas.
* Recently, there was a slew of ad campaigns from AT&T and Verizon that were all about “coverage maps.” The goal of the ads were to convince the consumer that either Verizon or AT&T had better overall coverage. Thanks to a nifty iPhone app, you can see for yourself…
* Coverage is a simple iPhone app that allows you to view AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile’s 2G, 3G and roaming coverage in the U.S.A. The app’s tagline is, “Bask in the joys of mobile bandwidth while avoiding the sorrows of roaming usage caps and absent signal.”

* The app’s interface is just a map with 4 toggles for each carrier. There are also three options to switch between roaming coverage, 2G coverage (EDGE) and 3G coverage.
* Coverage also allows you to view Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. It’s kind of cool to see how overwhelmingly red it gets when you switch the Verizon toggle on. This map does not reflect speeds for areas of coverage, simply that an area is covered.
* Coverage for iPhone is $1.99 in the App Store. It’s kind of a gimmick, but fun nonetheless.
* Are you excited for the Verizon iPhone? Will you be switching from AT&T?
