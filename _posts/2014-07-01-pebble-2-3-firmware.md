* Nearly a month into its most recent firmware update which has brought out a much-needed music volume control and Launcher item ordering, the maker of the Pebble smartwatch on Tuesday issued another firmware update while refreshing its companion iOS app with smaller changes.
* The Pebble 2.3 software update brings improved Bluetooth performance and, more importantly, enables the ability to quickly skip to the next notification by double clicking, in addition to other tweaks…
* As mentioned, the software update sports improved Bluetooth LE connectivity, various stability improvements and fixes and notification skipping with a double-click of the smartwatch’s up or down button.
* Pebble’s blog post explains:
* This new feature lets you quickly jump to the next notification if the current one you’re viewing requires scrolling to see all the content.
* As before, if the notification you’re viewing is short and displays entirely on your Pebble, a single click is all it takes to go to the next one.
* Pebble 2.3 firmware release notes:
* Pebble’s companion iOS app has been bumped up to version 2.2.2, offering additional JavaScript apps downloadable from the Pebble appstore.
* Pebble Smartwatch 2.2.2 app release notes:
* The Pebble app is available free in the App Store.
