* If you are an iPhone 3GS owner and feel left out because you can’t record HD videos on your iPhone, then rejoice because the jailbreak community is taking care of you.
* There is a new jailbreak app in Cydia called HD Video Enabler for 3GS. Just like its name suggests, this tweak will allow you to enable HD video recording on your iPhone 3GS…
* This is for iPhone 3GS only, and obviously, your iPhone has to be jailbroken, either with LimeRa1n, GreenPois0n, RedSn0w, or PwnageTool.
* I haven’t tried this myself. If you do give it a try, please make sure to leave your feedback in the comments section below.
