* Apple’s annual summer pilgrimage for its Mac and iOS developers, the Worldwide Developers Conference, is kicking off on Monday, June 8, 2015 and lasting through Friday, June 12, the company confirmed this morning.
* The five-day conference, twenty-sixth in a row, will take place at San Francisco’s Moscone West, “with more sessions than ever before streamed” online.
* Like prior WWDCs, this year’s conference will give Apple’s developer community and users around the world much more than a glimpse into the future of iOS and OS X.
* “The App Store ignited an app ecosystem that is simply amazing, forever changing the lives of customers and creating millions of jobs worldwide,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.
* “We’ve got incredible new technologies for iOS and OS X to share with developers at WWDC and around the world, and can’t wait to see the next generation of apps they create.”
* The conference will feature more than a hundred technical sessions, with over a thousand Apple engineers on site and hands-on labs to help developers integrate new technologies and fine tune their apps.
* The Apple Design Awards are on the agenda as well, which typically showcase the best new apps in the last year.
* Ticket registrations are open at the official WWDC website through Friday, April 17 at 10am PDT. Apple says it will randomly pick tickets to give everyone interested equal chance of attending the conference.
* Developers will know the status of their application by Monday, April 20 at 5pm PDT. “There will also be up to 350 WWDC Scholarships available, giving students and members of participating STEM organizations around the world the chance to earn a free ticket”, said Apple.
* Here are some conference highlights from Apple’s press release:
* Even if you don’t have a few thousand bucks to spend on a ticket and flight to San Francisco come June 8, select sessions will be live-streamed throughout the week at the WWDC website here and via the official WWDC app for the iPhone and iPad.
* “Videos from all technical sessions will also be available by the end of each day,” noted the firm. And yes, we’ll be providing detailed coverage of developments and report on any news that should interest you before, during and after WWDC 2015.
* We’re of course excited about previews of iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 and expect the company to update us on the state of third-party Watch development.
* Given the firm previously promised native Watch apps that run directly on the device (rather than stream off the iPhone) by year’s end, it’s safe to expect more news on that front.
* And if I were a betting man, I’d put my money on a next-generation Apple TV with a full-blown software development kit with apps and games via an Apple TV App Store.
