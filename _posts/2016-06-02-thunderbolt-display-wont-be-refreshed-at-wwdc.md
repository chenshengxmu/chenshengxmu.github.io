* Without naming a specific source, iMore’s Rene Ritchie has reportedly heard that Apple is not planning to refresh the aging 27-inch Thunderbolt Display at WWDC this month after all. “I asked around, and it’s not happening at the keynote or any time in the immediate future,” he wrote.
* The display was supposed to gain 5K resolution, a thinner design and an integrated graphics card so that older Macs could drive it, too.
* The whole idea of building a dedicated graphics card into the Thunderbolt Display sounded too good to be true in the first place. On the other hand, doing so would elegantly enable a single-cable Thunderbolt connection that could drive 5K resolution.
* On the downside, such a move would inevitable raise the display’s price.
* Another product that won’t see a major refresh at WWDC: the AirPort family of wireless appliances. Following a brief period when AirPorts were unavailable for purchase from Apple’s stores in the United States, these devices are now back in stock.
* We’re not surprised that the display won’t be refreshed at the conference. After all, WWDC is primarily a software-focused event specifically aimed at developers.
* Still, unveiling new hardware at WWDC wouldn’t be unheard of: at WWDC 2013, Apple did preview the new Mac Pro months months before it landed on store shelves.
* WWDC keynote is happening on Monday, June 13, at 10am.
