* Popular RSS feed reader Reeder 2 has received a significant update this evening, bringing the app to version 2.6. The update includes a handful of highly-requested new features, such as support for the larger displays of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and Landscape mode (iOS 8 only).
* Additionally, 2.6 brings about support for iOS 8’s share extensions, adding the now-familiar “More” option to Reeder’s share sheet. This will allow users to share articles and other content they come across in Reeder to other services outside of the app’s default sharing options.
* Rounding out today’s update is a handful of bug fixes. The change log for Reeder says that 2.6 includes “various bug fixes for iOS 8,” and corrects a known issue related to “failed authentication error handling.” The bottom line here is that Reeder 2 should now play nicely with iOS 8.
* Despite the demise of Google Reader last year, Reeder 2 has remained a go-to app for RSS users. It supports Feedbin, Feedly, and various other RSS services, and is worth checking out if you’re in the market for such an app. You can find the latest version of Reeder 2 in the App Store for $5.
