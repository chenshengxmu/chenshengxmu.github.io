* It’s extremely likely that the two-tone back panels we’ve been seeing over the past few months are indicative of what we’ll see on Apple’s next smartphone. And some folks aren’t very happy about that.
* But for those of you who like the design, you don’t have to wait until next month to enjoy it. A new ‘iPhone 5’ mod kit has surfaced that allows you to convert your iPhone 4/4S into Apple’s next-gen handset…
* The mod kit includes a back panel, and both Phillips-head and Pentalobe (Five-Point Star) screw drivers. The back panel is made of aluminum, glass-like acrylic, and includes an original glass lens cover.
* While it sounds like these things are well-made, we obviously have no way of knowing that. It is worth mentioning, however, that the manufacturer describes them as ‘durable,’ and offers a 30-day return policy.
* If you are interested, the mod kits run $29.99 a pop. The price includes free worldwide shipping, unless you want it shipped via Speedpost (guaranteed 5-7 day delivery), and you get to choose white or black.
* So, what are your thoughts on the ‘iPhone 5’ mod kit?
