* Today, Apple made the official announcement for the iPhone event to be held on September 10. The event is expected to announce the much anticipated iPhone 5S, a colorful range of iPhone 5C‘s, and the updated iOS 7 operating system. Each time there is an official invitation, many skeptics try to predict what exactly is meant by every little piece of graphical evidence on the image. However, some people spend their time more creatively by creating wallpapers.
* In a special mid-week wallpaper update, we are pleased to post copies of Bas van der Ploeg’s originals, created exclusively for the September Apple event. If you are as excited as I am, take a look past the fold for the first chance to download full resolution originals…
* Taking inspiration from the invitation, van der Ploeg quickly took to recreating, with a special twist, the Apple event invitation. A designer by trade, van der Ploeg hosts his own gallery, designs icons, and can be found via Twitter @basvanderploeg. Make sure to check out his other wallpaper downloads as well.
* For a slight variation, @Surenix also posted some excellent wallpapers, hosted on his Dribbble account.

* iPhone 5: iOS 6 (left); iOS 7 (right)
* iPad: full retina
* For those wondering, the iOS 7 version allows space for the clock and unlock text. Also, the iPhone 5 versions are appropriate for all previous iPhones. Simply double tap the image when setting as wallpaper for an automatic adjustment. Finally, the retina iPad version fits all previous iPad’s, including the mini.
* Tap the corresponding image above and wait for the full resolution to load. Once loaded, on your iOS device tap and hold. Then, save a copy, which appears in the Camera Roll. From the Camera Roll or Settings.app, set the new images as either Lock or Home screen images. From your desktop, right click the full image and save it to your iTunes sync folder.
* If you love to check out new wallpapers, make sure you visit the iDownloadBlog Wallpapers of the Week section, which is updated every Sunday.
* What do you guys think? I love these new images. Any last minute announcement predictions?
