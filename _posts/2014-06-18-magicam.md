* Camera+ is still my favorite go-to photo editing software on both the iPhone and iPad so you could imagine me jumping with joy learning that Taptaptap, the Camera+ developer, has just released a brand new photography software.
* Framed as a bold, new experience in iPhone photography, MagiCam is focused on snapping photos and transforming them into gorgeous, eye-catching shots with little or no effort on your part.
* You can grab it for just 99 cents in the App Store and I have a video of it in action right after the break…
* From the blurb:
* MagiCam gives you 1-tap perfection for every photo you shoot. No need to learn any complex photography terms or techniques. Just amazing results every time.
* Check out the promotional video.
* There are nine photo moods that you can live preview.
* Sharing choices include standard services like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Messages, email and more. The simplified camera interface allow you switch between the front and back camera, turn on the flash, zoom in and out and opt for a square format popularized by Instagram.
* There’s not much else to say about MagiCam, really. If you typically take a lot of selfies and have been on the lookout for a no-frills photography app that’s easy and simple to use, you should give MagiCam a whirl.
* For more information, check out the official website or read a nice review by MacStories editor Federico Viticci.
* Taptaptap is perhaps best known for its Camera+ app for the iPhone and iPad, which since its inception in 2009 has been downloaded more than twelve million times.
* Buy MagiCam for a limited introductory price of $0.99.
* The app is native on the iPhone and iPod touch and requires iOS 7.0 or later.
