* Amazon is expected to unveil its first smartphone in the not-so-distant future, and according to a new report from BGR, this is what it’s going to look like. The site says the image on the above slide was created for internal use by graphic designers at Amazon.
* Note that the handset looks quite different than the prototype we saw last month—BGR explains this is because that device was housed in a protective casing. The actual phone’s design resembles that of the iPhone and other smartphones currently on the market…
* BGR’s Zach Epstein reports:
* The image above is the first to reveal the design of Amazon’s debut smartphone. Multiple trusted sources have verified the authenticity of the image, which was created for internal use by graphic designers at Amazon. […]
* In terms of size, we’re told that the phone is a bit large but is reasonably comfortable to use with one hand. Amazon’s unique gesture controls were designed in part to make one-handed operation of a large phone as easy as possible, and one source tells us the phone definitely succeeds in that regard. 
* Amazon is entering an extremely saturated smartphone market, some 4-5 years too late, but the e-commerce giant intends to stand out with innovative features. Its new phone is believed to include a glasses-free 3D display and a tilt-based, gesture interface.
* As far as hardware, the Amazon phone is expected to have a 4.7-inch 720p display, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM and believe it or not, 6 cameras. Four of them will be used for the 3D tech, and then a traditional front and back.

* On the software side, as you’d expect, the handset will be running a highly-customized version of Android. And because of that, it’ll likely feature Amazon’s own mobile app and content stores, instead of the usual Google Play stores you see on stock Android phones.
* Rumor has it that the device will be very competitively priced, and BGR makes mention of a so-called ‘Prime Data’ feature, which could be an Amazon-exlusive, carrier-exclusive data plan. Amazon is expected to unveil the phone in June, ahead of a September launch.
* What are your thoughts so far on Amazon’s rumored smartphone? Interesting?
