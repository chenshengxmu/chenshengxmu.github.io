* You have got to love Apple’s sense of humor. The folks in Cupertino have left a nice easter egg in the latest iOS 5.1 beta. 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman went looking inside the 5.1 beta 2’s .plist files and came across something that made us chuckle.
* Apple knows how the blogosphere works, and the rumor mill typically predicts future product names based off internal references in iOS beta SDKs. It looks like we all just hit the jackpot.
* the references that go up to <device>11,1 have been in iOS 5 since beta 1 too, just in another place that they probably think people look.

* Based on this .plist, we know that there will be an Apple TV 9, iPad 10, iPhone 11, and something weird called “iFPGA.” We’re going to bank on that last one being an iMicrowave.
