* Good news this afternoon for folks who have been dealing with teething issues in the just-released OS X Mavericks. Apple has posted updates today for the Mail and iBooks apps, which should resolve two of the more popular complaints.
* The iBooks update brings the app to version 1.0.1 and includes bug fixes and stability improvements. And the Mail update promises to improve general stability and compatibility with Gmail, solving issues that made the client unreliable…
* Here are your iBooks release notes:
* iBooks Update 1.0.1 
* This version of iBooks includes bug fixes and improvements to performance and stability.
* And here are the Mail release notes:
* Mail Update for Mavericks includes improvements to general stability and compatibility with Gmail, including the following:
* – Fixes an issue that prevents deleting, moving, and archiving messages for users with custom Gmail settings
* – Addresses an issue that may cause unread counts to be inaccurate
* Earlier this week, it was reported that Apple was working on fixes for several apps, including iBooks, Mail, Safari, and Remote Desktop. And although the first two were released today, there’s no word on when we’ll see the last two appear.
* As usual, current OS X Mavericks users can download and install these updates by visiting the ‘Updates’ tab in the Mac App Store (if you don’t already have automatic updates enabled).
