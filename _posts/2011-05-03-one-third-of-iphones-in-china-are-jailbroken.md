* The iPhone is selling very well in China. In fact, China is Apple’s fastest growing market for the iPhone.
* According to a recent survey by UMeng, a Chinese statistic firm, 34.6% (roughly one third) of the iPhones in China are jailbroken. The iPhone accounts for 8.3% of China’s 850 million mobile customers.
* Closer look after the break…
* TechNode translates UMeng’s findings:
* Nearly half of the iPhone 3GSs and iPhone 4s in China are jailbroken. That’s a staggering number when you consider that there are around 60 million iPhones in China alone.
* UMeng does state that these numbers to not directly affect Chinese app piracy on the iOS platform. A lot of iPhones get sold on the grey market, and jailbreaking services are usually offered for free with purchases.

* We wonder how familiar the Chinese population is with the jailbreak community. Do they use RedSn0w? PwnageTool? Most of the jailbroken iPhones probably use UltraSn0w for a carrier unlock.
* Here’s a shout-out to our Chinese readers! If you live in China, or are familiar with this topic, share your thoughts with us in the comments!
