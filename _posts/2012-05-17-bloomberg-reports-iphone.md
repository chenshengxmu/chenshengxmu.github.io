* I know what you’re thinking: great, another iPhone rumor. Well, in less than 6 months, the world’s most popular tech company is expected to give its most popular product a major makeover — get used to them. Now, onto the latest rumblings.
* Citing sources with “knowledge of the plans,” Bloomberg is out with a new report tonight regarding Apple’s next smartphone. Not only does the news outlet confirm previous reports that it has a larger screen, but it says Steve Jobs himself designed it…
* “Apple Inc. (AAPL) is preparing to overhaul the look of its iPhone, three people with knowledge of the plans said, refreshing the company’s top-selling product amid competition from rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co.
* Apple, based in Cupertino, California, has placed orders from suppliers in Asia for screens that are bigger than the 3.5- inch size now on the smartphone, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had worked closely on the redesigned phone before his death in October, one person said.”
* While it’s not surprising that Jobs had a hand in the design, it’s interesting to hear that he “worked closely” on the device during what were likely his final months. It certainly adds to the mounting pile of anticipation for the handset.
* It’s also worth noting that this now makes three major news publications that have independently confirmed Apple is ordering displays larger than 3.5″ for its next iPhone, suggesting we might actually see the long-awaited redesign this year.
* Is it just me, or would it be cool to see Jobs’ napkin drawings of designs for the next-generation iPhone?
