* Following big updates for Mac OS X and iTunes, Apple has this afternoon published an update for its iOS Podcasts client. The update brings the app to version 2.1, and includes a handful of new features and improvements.
* Among the new features are Siri integration and support for CarPlay. Users can now ask Siri to play specific podcasts by simply saying ‘play’ and then the name of the podcast file, and control the app using a CarPlay vehicle…
* Here are your full release notes:
