* Copenhagen, Denmark-based game developer Playdead has been enjoying huge successes selling three million copies of its puzzle action adventure game Limbo on the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Steam, Playstation Vita, as well as Windows and Mac PCs.
* As we told you last week, Playdead was readying an App Store version of Limbo and today the game has finally arrived to your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices. You won’t want to miss out on this one, trust me…
* If you’re not familiar with Limbo, you’re an unnamed kid who enters the Limbo world in search of his sister.
* But first, your teaser trailer.
* Unlike your typical time-killer, you’re expected to fail in Limbo before finding the correct solution so brace yourself for a lot of trial-and-death before you play this game through the end.

* It’s not for the faint-hearted either: Limbo features gruesome imagery depicting the many ways your character can die, designed to steer you from unworkable solutions.
* Developers used the Box2D system to engineer the physics-based world and your character, as well as implement the 2D sidescrolling concept.

* Like the stunning and eerie Year Walk, Limbo too is an example of video games as art, winning the game numerous awards and accolades. For instance, Limbo was the third-highest selling game on the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2010, generating around $7.5 million in revenue.

* The game supports iPad 2 and higher, iPad Mini, iPhone 4S and higher and the latest-generation iPod touch.
* Limbo will set you back five bucks, which will buy you a universal binary supporting all your form-factor iOS devices natively.
* Those in the market for a puzzle adventure game and folks on the lookout for something quite different to the crop of boring App Store games can’t go wrong with Limbo.
* Does Limbo look like something you’d be willing to play?
