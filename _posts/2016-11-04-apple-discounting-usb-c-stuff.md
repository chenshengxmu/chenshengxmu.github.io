* Apple on Friday announced that it would be temporarily cutting the prices on USB-C adapters and peripherals it sells in its stores. In a statement sent to several publications, the company said that it recognizes many users still rely on legacy connectors to get work done, and it wants to help them move to the latest technology.
* “We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made. It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility.
* We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.”
* Per The Loop, the following adapters are included:
* Apple has taken a significant amount of backlash over its new MacBook Pros in recent weeks. Included in the criticism are the laptop’s lack of legacy ports (obviously), performance limitations, and notable price increase. It seems clear Apple has heard the complaints, given Phil Schiller’s comments and this accessory price cut.
