* Apple loves to use and impose new standards for their products. That’s why you need a micro SIM in order to use an iPad 3G or the iPhone 4.
* If like me you travel a lot and get SIM cards in various countries to use in your unlocked iPhone 4, you’re going to need a SIM card cutter, as most carriers aren’t offering micro SIMs, especially for pay-as-you-go plans.
* Sure you could do this yourself, but do you really want to take the risk of messing up your SIM card? If not, then a SIM card cutter is your best bet…
* A few weeks ago, the guys at MicroSIM Solutions offered to send me their micro SIM cutter for review. As a frequent international traveler, I knew this would come in handy at some point. And it did, when I arrived in Paris last week.
* I had been practicing with their micro SIM card cutter on several used SIM cards I had at home, and I had noticed that not all chips are the same size on a SIM card. Some of them are actually slightly bigger than a micro SIM. Knowing this, I was really hoping the SIM card I was going to get in France would be the right size.
* At my arrival in Paris, I asked my cousin (who picked me up at the airport) to give me the SIM card I had pre-ordered via a friend of mine. A quick look at it reassured me as it seemed to be the right size.
* I grabbed my SIM cutter, popped the Bouygues Telecom SIM card in it, and pressed the handle to punch/trim the card. I then opened the SIM tray of my iPhone 4, put the newly trimmed card in it, rebooted, and voila. 5 seconds later, I was already taking advantage of this SIM card by checking emails and Twitter. Simple, quick, painless.
* MicroSIM Solutions’ SIM cutter is the only one I ever used so I can’t really compare to other similar devices. For having used it myself, I can tell this is a very good product that does the job as described.
* The SIM cutter came in a very nice black box, in line with Apple’s design. Sure the packaging doesn’t matter much, but it’s always nice to receive something in a nice box, isn’t it?
* In the box was the SIM cutter as well as 2 free SIM adapters. Very convenient if you cut a SIM card, but later need to put it back in an iPhone 3GS for example. The SIM adapter will allow you to do that without any problem.
* You can buy MicroSIM’s solution SIM cutter for 25 Euros, or about $30, with free shipping worldwide. All in all, I think it’s a very good product at a reasonable price.
