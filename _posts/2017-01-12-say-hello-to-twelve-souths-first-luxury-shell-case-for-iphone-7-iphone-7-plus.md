* It’s certainly been a busy start to 2017 for premium accessory maker Twelve South, which today launched its first ever shell case for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Aptly named RelaxedLeather, it’s hand-burnished along the edges and corners so that it ages naturally with time, giving it unique look and feel.
* Quilted microfiber lines a 5-sided recessed shell to keep your phone in pristine condition and protect it from everyday drops and falls. RelaxedLeather is offered with or without external pockets and in five warm colors.
* Twelve South says the case is inspired by the “laid-back luxury of burnished leather boots,” with colors pulled directly from from runway trends and Pantone defined colors of the season, including rich tones of taupe, herb and marsala.
* From the Twelve South website:
* Looking at other accessories—from footwear to handbags to watchbands—when it comes to leather, the trend is a rustic, lived-in vibe. Shadowed toes on boots, oxblood handbags with creases and folds and cognac briefcases that cost more the older they look.
* This is the inspiration for our new RelaxedLeather, a warm-toned burnished leather case with vintage personality right out of the box.
* The case is available in two sizes, 4.7 inches for iPhone 7 and 5.5 inches for iPhone 7 Plus, comes in several color options—Black, Cognac, Dried Herb, Marsala and Warm Taupe—and in versions with or without external pockets for credit cards and cash.

* RelaxedLeather for iPhone 7 is priced at $39.99 (without pockets) or $10 more if you want a version with pockets. The iPhone 7 Plus edition of RelaxedLeather is $49.99 with pockets, or $39.99 without pockets.
