* Messages, one of the most frequently used application in iOS, stores on your device text messages, iMessages and any media attached to them. Like most people, I message my friends and family quite a lot on any given day.
* Needless to say, animated GIFs, pictures, videos and other media attached to messages can easily clog up your iPhone’s storage, which can be especially problematic on devices with just sixteen gigabytes of storage.
* What most users don’t realise is that deleting a conversation doesn’t remove it immediately from the Messages database on your device.
* Thankfully, iOS provides a setting for how long to keep messages on your device. This tutorial will teach you how to tell Messages to permanently delete your conversations after 30 days or one year.
* Step 1: Launch Settings on your iOS device.
* Step 2: Tap on Messages.
* Step 3: Now tap on the Keep Messages option under the Message History heading.
* Step 4: Lastly, set for how long you would like to keep messages on your iPhone: 30 Days, 1 Year or Forever.

* Step 5: Depending on your choice, you might be prompted to confirm it by tapping the Delete button.

* If you set message expiration to 30 days, for example, you’ll be warned that all text messages and their attachments on your device that are older than 30 days will be permanently deleted.
* Messages default to keeping your conversations on the device permanently.

* I’d recommend changing message expiration to 30 days if you exchange lots of media-rich messages with your friends and family and your iPhone is low on storage.
