* Google today pushed out an update for its Play Music iOS client, bringing the app to the odd version number of 2.0.3828. The update is rather significant in that it brings about proper support for the iPad, as well as new Material Design UI for the iPhone.
* In the changelog Google says that it has heard users “loud and clear, and now Google Play Music has an official iPad app.” It looks very similar to the redesigned iPhone app, sporting Google’s new Material Design aesthetic, but with larger UI elements.

* As part of the Material makeover, the Play Music app now features “beautiful new artist and album pages with descriptions” and an”immersive Now Playing experience.” Google also notes that it has made several “small visual improvements throughout.”
* Rounding out today’s update are improvements to streaming and automatic caching, which should make music playback faster and more reliable. If you’re invested at all in Google’s Play ecosystem, or just want to check it out, you’ll want to grab this update.
* Google Play Music can be found in the App Store for free. The music service itself, which offers on-demand access to more than 30 million songs, is free to try for 1 month, and $9.99 per month after that.
