* Microsoft’s Xbox One companion app, SmartGlass, has been bumped to version 2.5 earlier today, bringing out a handful of new features that improve your living room experience and interactions with the console itself.
* Most importantly, the app now features a remote control functionality similar to Apple’s free Remote software. But as Microsoft’s console lets you hook up a cable or satellite box to it, you can now basically channel surf from across the room using your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.
* The update is now live in the App Store and I have a full list of features for your right after the break…
* The new OneGuide is now available on your iOS device so you can see all your TV and app channels in one place. Twitch is integrated, too, so if you’re a fan of user-recorded in-game videos, the app makes it easy discover and play Twitch broadcasts.
