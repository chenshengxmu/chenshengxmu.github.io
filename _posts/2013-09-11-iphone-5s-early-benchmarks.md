* One of the big new features in the iPhone 5s is its A7 processor with ’64-bit desktop-class architecture.’ What these buzzwords essentially mean is that the thing is fast—Apple says the CPU is 40x faster and graphics are 56x faster than the original iPhone.
* But that doesn’t really tell us much in the way of performance, does it? Luckily, an early graphics benchmark for the handset surfaced this morning that gives us a better idea of how the 5s will perform. And the results show significant gains over the iPhone 5…
* MacRumors points a comparison between the results of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5 on the Egypt HD 2.5 benchmark. Note how the score on the offscreen 1080p test goes from 29.8 fps (frames per second) on the 5 to 56.0 on the 5s. Nearly double—nice.

* Of course, we’ve seen first-hand that benchmarks can’t be taken at face value. They merely show what a device can do under optimal conditions, which isn’t indicative of real-world usage. In this instance, for example, the test has been optimized for the new A7.
* Still the results are pretty impressive. And eventually, most developers will have optimized their apps and games for the new 64-bit processor. But until then, we’re going to count this as an example of, not necessarily proof of, the 5s’ graphic performance.
