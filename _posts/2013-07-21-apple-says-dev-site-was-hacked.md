* On Friday, we noted that Apple’s developer center—where it hosts downloads, documentation and other resources—had been down for a record 48 hours. Well here it is Sunday, and the dev portal appears to still be out of commission.
* At first, the company was mum on the outage, saying only that it was sorry that “maintenance was taking longer than expected,” and that it would make up for the lost time. But today, it broke the silence, announcing it has been hacked…
* Here’s the email Apple has been sending out to developers this afternoon (via AllThingsD):
* “Apple Developer Website Update
* Last Thursday, an intruder attempted to secure personal information of our registered developers from our developer website. Sensitive personal information was encrypted and cannot be accessed, however, we have not been able to rule out the possibility that some developers’ names, mailing addresses, and/or email addresses may have been accessed. In the spirit of transparency, we want to inform you of the issue. We took the site down immediately on Thursday and have been working around the clock since then.
* In order to prevent a security threat like this from happening again, we’re completely overhauling our developer systems, updating our server software, and rebuilding our entire database. We apologize for the significant inconvenience that our downtime has caused you and we expect to have the developer website up again soon.”
* Apple has confirmed with Macworld that the breached server was not associated with any customer info and that all personal information is encrypted. Additionally, it says the attackers did not have access to app code or servers with app data.
