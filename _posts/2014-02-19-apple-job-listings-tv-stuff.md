* While it seems like everyone is focused on Apple’s rumored iWatch, and the various features it could offer, the company is believed to be quietly working on another major project: a TV device. Not the television set we used to hear rumors about, but a new set-top box.
* Adding to recent reports from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal regarding the project are a pair of job listings recently discovered on Apple’s website. They call for a Content Partner Engineer and Software QA Engineer—both of which will work on the Apple TV team…
* Here’s the description for the content partner engineer position, first spotted by AppleInsider:
* The Apple TV team is looking for an experienced engineer with a passion for delivering first in class home entertainment solutions. The candidate will work with talented engineers in a fast paced, technically demanding environment. The individual must be self motivated, an excellent problem solver and a fast learner. Very strong technical skills and a track record of multi-tasking is a must.
* This listing is particularly interesting, as recent reports have suggested that Apple has had to dial down its TV plans and take a less ambitious approach. It’s now said to be seeking cable provider partners for its set-top box, rather than going after individual deals with networks.
* All somewhat intriguing are the responsibilities listed for the position which include ‘conducting vendor UI reviews with internal design teams’ and garnering feedback from vendors regarding ‘new features to include in Apple TV.’ This isn’t your basic technical support job.
* Apple has been slowly adding new ‘apps,’ or channels, to current Apple TV devices including HBO Go and Disney. But the revamped set-top box, slated to launch as early as April, is said to include features like a DVR, app/game store integration and possibly motion controls.
