* These past few weeks have felt pretty stale for the jailbreak community, but this week has seen a slight resurgence. Unfortunately, with no public announcements from reputable jailbreak teams at this point in time, there’s still no news as to when a public jailbreak for iOS 10 may drop.
* Regardless, developers continue to make tweaks for iOS 9. In this roundup, we’ll show you everything that was released this week, starting with our favorites.
* Columba for iOS 9 – $0.99

* Columba for iOS 9 was easily the most robust release of the week, bringing biteSMS-like features to the stale messaging experience on an iOS 9 device.
* It’ll become your new best friend whether you use iMessage or SMS. Among the things you can do are bring up a detailed quick compose window, schedule messages for a later date and time, save message templates, and even access improved quick reply features.
* All for less than a dollar, this tweak is a steal. You can read our full review of Columba for iOS 9 to learn more about how it works.
* Force Delete – FREE

* Force Delete is a pretty cool new tweak that lets you both delete App Store apps and hide system apps with nothing more than a 3D Touch gesture.
* The ability to hide system apps alone is worth it, but with the added 3D Touch integration, it can be really fun to use. Moreover, it works on non-3D Touch devices with the help of revealMenu.
* You can read our full review of Force Delete to learn more about how it works in detail.
* ColorCalculator: Lets you colorize the Calculator app (free – review)
* ClearShot: Puts a clear screen frame at the beginning of every app launch (free)
* LockLaunchApp: Adds an app launcher for up to six apps to your Lock screen ($0.99 – review)
* SmallHint: Gives you a small hint about your passcode for your iPhone (free – review)
* Although that wraps it up for this week, you can go back to last week’s roundup to see if you missed anything from before.
