* Comedian and talk show host Stephen Colbert is known for being an Apple fan. He regularly makes Apple-related jokes on his show, and a recent episode shows him having quite the conversation with Siri, the personal assistant in the iPhone 4S.
* We know the video is in Flash but we have no control over it and couldn’t find an iOS-friendly replacement.
* You can watch Colbert’s farewell to Steve Jobs for a touching tribute from one truly funny guy.
