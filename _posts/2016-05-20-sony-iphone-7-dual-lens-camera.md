* Remember the rumor, backed by a report from reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, that only a 5.5-inch model of an ‘iPhone 7’ would have a dual-lens camera while its 4.7-inch brethren would get stuck with a boring single-camera module?
* Now we know where that came from: Apple’s camera supplier Sony has fallen behind schedule, prompting the iPhone maker to add another dual-camera supplier to the mix: LG’s Innotek division. That’s the current word on the street, according to a Barron’s report citing Nomura Securities analysts.
* Sony CFO Kenichiro Yoshida revealed during the company’s earnings call last year that its dual-lens camera technology will find its way into gadgets from “major smartphone players” next year, without mentioning Apple by name.
* However, Nomura analyst Chris Chang doesn’t think Sony will be able to fulfill dual-camera orders from Apple due to lower-than-expected yield and damage to its production facility from the April earthquake in Kumamoto.
* “As a result, we think LGI will gain majority share of the initial dual camera orders from Apple,” he wrote. The analyst estimated that dual-camera packages are likely to command 2.5x higher average selling price over their single-camera counterparts.
* “The dual camera will be used in all new 5.5-inch iPhones,” he added.

* Interestingly enough, Chang is adamant that optical image stabilization technology (OIS) will be featured on both 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 models, unlike previous rumors which called for OIS being a 5.5-inch model exclusive, as it is currently.
