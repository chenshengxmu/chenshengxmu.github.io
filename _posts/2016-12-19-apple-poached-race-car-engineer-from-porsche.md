* Earlier this year, Apple poached Alexander Hitzinger, the former technical director of Porsche’s race car program who helped the car maker return to the Le Mans endurance race, a company source told Reuters last Friday. The move was first reported by Germany’s Manager Magazin.
* Volkswagen-owned Porsche officially confirmed Hitzinger had left the luxury carmaker in the spring, but didn’t share any further information.
* As per his LinkedIn profile, Hitzinger left Porsche in March to join an unnamed tech firm located in the San Francisco Bay Area as an engineering executive in April.
* During his tenure at Porsche, Hitzinger expanded a development team from ten to over 150 employees and helped return Porsche to endurance racing. He was instrumental in the development of the 919 hybrid sports car from scratch.
* Over the past few months, Apple also poached employees from Here, a Berlin-based automotive mapping company, for mapping jobs in its secretive Maps office in Berlin.
