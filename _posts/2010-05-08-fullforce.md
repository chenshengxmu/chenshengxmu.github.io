title: FullForce Forces Your iPhone Apps to Display in Full Screen Mode on iPad
---
* A few days ago I shared with you a hack to make your iPhone apps run in full screen mode on your iPad. This hack requires a few steps that might scare away those of you who don’t feel like playing with the core files of applications.
* Lucky for us, one of my favorite jailbreak developer, Ryan Petrich, created FullForce, an application that “force selects applications to show in full screen iPad mode, even if the developer hasn’t certified them as compatible”.

* The result? Even if an application like Facebook can’t be properly displayed in full screen mode on your iPad, FullForce will work its magic and make the app fit the whole screen without pixelizing it.
* You can download FullForce from Cydia for free. Once installed, go to the settings.app and in the FullForce options, select the applications you want to force.
* Note that FullForce doesn’t work with all applications. Just like the hack, text based apps such as Facebook and Tweetie work best in full screen mode.
* FullForce is developed specifically for iPad so it can safely be added to the list of iPad compatible jailbrak apps.
