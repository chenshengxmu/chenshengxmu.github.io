* Is it the speed? The acceleration and pure velocity? Nah, it’s got to be going Airborne, says the clever blurb for Gameloft’s highly-anticipated eighth installment in the Asphalt mobile racing franchise. We previewed the game back in June and although it got delayed a bit as the team needed more time to perfect the little things, it’s out now and available now for your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad for just 99 cents a pop. I’ve included action-packed screenies, additional info and a launch trailer so jump past the fold for more awesomeness…
* Asphalt 8: Airborne invites you to leave gravity in the dust:
* The best iOS arcade racing game series reaches a new turning point! Perform dynamic, high-speed aerial stunts in an intense driving experience powered by a brand-new physics engine!
* Getting airborne entails hitting the ramps and performing barrel rolls and wild 360-degree jumps. The fact that you can maneuver through the air while pulling off stunts adds a dash of Fast and Furious craziness to the game, I guess.
* Airborne features 47 high-performance luxury dream cars, with 80 percent new to the series, from top licensed manufacturers and models such as the Lamborghini Veneno, Bugatti Veyron, Ferrari FXX and Pagani Zonda R.
* The team went all out to make this Asphalt edition the funniest and most engaging racing game on iOS so they recorded all motor sounds from scratch, and in high-fidelity.
* Here’s the launch trailer.
* The racing action takes place across nine different exotic locations like Venice, French Guiana, Iceland, the Nevada Desert and more. The tracks feature hidden shortcuts and can be played in original and mirror variations in Career mode for some added variety.
* This is arguably the prettiest racing game on iOS. If you own one of the latest iOS devices such as an iPhone 5 or iPad 4, you’ll be treated to stunning visuals, courtesy of Gameloft’s next-gen shaders, real-time geometry reflection and other special effects.
* Check out the screenies.
