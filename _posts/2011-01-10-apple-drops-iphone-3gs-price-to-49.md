* 4 days after AT&T slashed the price of the iPhone 3GS, it’s now Apple who’s discounting the previous iPhone model to the same $49 price tag. I think this move isn’t so much related to the Verizon iPhone being announced tomorrow, but rather to getting rid off their old inventory.
* If you don’t care about owning the latest and bestest, then the iPhone 3GS at $49 is a hell of a deal. If like me you do like to get the latest gadget, you may want to wait until June/July, when the iPhone 5 will be released… 
* Oh yeah, and this cheap baby comes with a 2-year ball and chain contract with AT&T. You ready for that?
* [Apple]
