* Get ready, it looks like iPad-wielding picture-takers are about to multiply. According to a new report, Apple is going to beef up the iSight cameras in both its fifth generation iPad and second generation iPad mini this year.
* Highly regarded analyst Ming-Chi Kuo sent out a note to investors this afternoon, claiming that the two tablets—which are expected to be unveiled later this month—will feature 8-megapixel shooters with larger apertures…
* Here’s an excerpt from the note (via MacRumors):
* “We predict Apple (US) will launch new iPad 5 and iPad mini 2 (so called retina iPad mini) in 4Q13. As the tablet market becomes increasingly competitive, Apple could upgrade the camera as a selling point for the new iPad in a bid to increase competitiveness. We expect the upgrade will include 8MP rear camera, up from 5MP, and larger aperture. Lens module ASP will rise 10-20% on this optics spec upgrade.”
* As Kuo mentions, both the iPad 4 and current-gen iPad mini sport 5MP cameras, so this would be a significant improvement for the devices. He also believes they’ll feature a similar aperture to that found in the iPhone 5s.
* It sounds like the two tablets are set to receive big upgrades. The iPad 5 will be getting a redesign, while the mini is said to be getting a Retina display and Touch ID. And both have been rumored to run variations of the A7.
* Recent reports have suggested that supplies for the Retina iPad mini will be extremely limited at launch time, but that’s not expected to affect its unveiling. We’re looking for a media event to take place sometime this month.
