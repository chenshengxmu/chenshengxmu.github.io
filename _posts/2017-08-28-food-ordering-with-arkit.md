* Apple’s new ARKit framework for building immersive augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad is getting major support from enthusiastic developers ahead of iOS 11’s public release in the fall, with a new food-ordering technology demo showcasing the benefits of seeing near photographic-quality virtual foods on your plate prior to ordering.
* The proof-of-concept app demonstrated in the video embedded right below was built with iOS 11’s new ARKit framework by a company called Kobaq, which offers high-quality realistic food models for augmented, virtual and mixed reality experiences.
* It’s not hard seeing why restaurant chains might want to adopt ARKit.
* An ARKit food menu could permit restaurateurs to present their foods in glorious 3D graphics, providing stunning visualization of the dishes and thereby opportunities for upselling.
* As another example, an ARKit cookbook could be especially compelling because, unlike with 2D photographs and videos, it could give you a feel for the food’s appearance and portion size.
* I reached out to Kobaq to see if they’re planning on turning this awesome technology showcase into a real app when iOS 11 launches, and will update if they respond. For more ARKit-powered demos, check out our ARKit archive and the madewitharkit.com website.
* As per Apple, ARKit apps will be supported on iPhone/iPad models with the A9 chip or newer.
