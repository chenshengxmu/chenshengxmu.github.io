* With a new free jailbreak tweak called CCWallCustomizer by iKilledAppl3, you can change the background of your Control Center interface on iOS 10.
* The tweak can use any image you choose from your Photo Library as the source for your background. You can easily save any image you want from the web or snap your own pictures with the Camera to be used.
* CCWallCustomizer will add a new preferences pane in the Settings app where you can easily set up the background you intend to use for Control Center:

* Here, you will find a selector button you can tap on to choose an image; tapping on it brings you to your Photo Library. After selection, you will be prompted to crop the image so that it appears correctly as your Control Center background.
* Once applied, your device will respring automatically. When it comes back up, you can then swipe up to reveal Control Center and see how your new background looks.
* The preferences pane also includes a button for removing the current image from Control Center, which is useful when you want to go back to stock without uninstalling the tweak entirely.
* It’s worth noting that not all backgrounds are going to look good in Control Center because some colors can conflict with the text and colors in the interface. I recommend as under-detailed of images as possible, such as the landscape image used in this example. There is unfortunately no way to adjust the opacity of the image, which if added, would help a lot with this potential issue.
* Also, if you’re using other jailbreak tweaks that change the way Control Center looks, such as Noctis, you will want to avoid installing this tweak at the same time at this point in time because they’re not currently compatible.

* CCWallCustomizer is a pretty neat way to customize your jailbroken iOS 10 device in a way that someone who wasn’t jailbroken could never do. If you’re interested in giving it a try, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today.
