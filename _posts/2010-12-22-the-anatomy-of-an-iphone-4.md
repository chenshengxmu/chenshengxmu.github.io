* This is the first of an ongoing series of videos that will provide in-depth coverage of the iPhone. Initially we will be targeting basic iPhone usage, such as the device’s anatomy, guides on how to keep the iPhone in great shape, and other essential, but basic information.
* Our goal is to provide a one-stop and comprehensive resource for all iPhone users, including those of you who are new to the wonderful world of iPhone. We hope that you will find these guides, walkthroughs, and tutorials beneficial, and encourage community feedback so that you can assist new ones.
