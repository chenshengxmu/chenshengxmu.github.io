* It’s been 5 days now since Google released its highly-anticipated Maps app for iOS, and it’s still the #1 free download in the App Store. With its vector graphics and exclusive features like Street View, the app is obviously a hit.
* But just how big of a hit are we talking? Well Google SVP of Commerce Jeff Huber gives us some insight on that via a post to his Google+ page. He says the Maps app saw more than 10 million downloads in the first 48 hours…
* From Huber’s Google+ post (via 9to5Mac):
* “More than 10 million downloads in less than 48 hours after release!
* We’re excited for the positive reception of Google Maps for iPhone around the world. Congratulations to the Maps Team on the recognition for the passion and hard work they poured into it, for this release and over the last 7+ years.”
* There’s no doubt that millions of consumers were waiting for the Google Maps release, as Apple’s software, which replaced Google back in September, has been plagued with inaccurate location data and other bugs since its debut.
* Now, for some context, here are some other app launch stats: OS X Mountain Lion, Apple’s latest Mac OS, was downloaded 3 million times during its first 4 days. And the jailbreak utility Absinthe saw about 1 million in its first day.
* In addition to the aforementioned vector graphics and Street View option, Google Maps has a number of other features including voice-guided navigation and transit instructions, which works with both Apple Maps and Siri.
