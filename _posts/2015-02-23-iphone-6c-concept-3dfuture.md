title: This iPhone 6c concept looks plausible

* We don’t know yet whether or not Apple will introduce an ‘iPhone 6c’ when a next-gen model debuts this fall but if it does, it might resemble these curiously looking mockups posted by 3DFuture.net.
* For what it’s worth, the prospect of refreshing its plastic handset with a fingerprint sensor, a bigger Retina HD screen, an improved eight-megapixel iSight camera and a speedy processor is certainly tantalizing.
* Check out the images after the jump and meet us in comments.
* Because there’s literally zero information about an iPhone 6c at the moment, 3DFuture has had to base these mockups on the existing iPhone 6 design combined with the iPhone 5c, which Apple continues to sell.
* Should they make the device a little thicker, the back camera could be flush against the casing. According to The New Yorker’s massive profile of Apple’s design head Jony Ive, the iPhone 6’s slightly protruding camera lens was “a really very pragmatic optimization.”

* I’m not sure that I like that color-coded metal ring around the Touch ID sensor, but can certainly see where that’s coming from. As you’ll recall, Apple boasted the fact that differently-colored iPhone 5c models have their sets of color-matched wallpapers.

* If Apple were to ditch the unibody metal frame and give the handset a plastic treatment, I suppose all iPhone 6c models would feature black frontplate for a more seamless appearance.

* If I were to buy one, I’d go with a blue variant.

* Typically, Apple sells past two iPhone generations alongside current models. That being said, it’s going to be interesting seeing what happens to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus when a next-generation model debuts this fall.

* So, how do you guys like this concept?
* And should Apple repackage the existing iPhone 6 into a plastic enclosure akin to the iPhone 5 back in 2013, do you think?
* Contrary to popular belief, I think the “unapologetically plastic” iPhone 5c doesn’t get nearly as much credit as it deserves. I bought one for my mom’s birthday and she’s absolutely loving it.
* In my mind, it really looks cute and sexy.
* The more I think of it, the more I’m convinced that providing a $100 cheaper iPhone 6c with a 4.7-inch or 5.5-inch screen, a faster A8 chip, Touch ID and updated wireless hardware would make lots of sense. And if it looked anything like these renderings, it’d be a commercial success, I’d wager.
* Thoughts?
