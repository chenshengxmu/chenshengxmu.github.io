* If you want to save the content of an email outside of your inbox, the best file format to choose is probably PDF as it is widely used and it can be shared and viewed across all platforms, including Windows PCs, Macs, iOS, and Android devices.
* In this post, I will show you how to save an email as PDF from your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, without having to use a third-party application. You will then be able to either share this PDF with someone, or save it locally on your device or your computer.
* For this tutorial, we will assume that you are using the default Mail application on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Most third-party email clients have their own feature to print an email to PDF, so the method depends greatly on the app you use. But if you use the stock Mail app, these instructions will work perfectly for you.
* The screenshots in this part of the guide were taken on an iPhone, but the steps are identical on iPad.
* 1) On your iPhone or iPad, select the email you want to save as a PDF document.
* 2) Tap on the forward button, and select Print.

* 3) You will now be presented with a preview of what your email would look like if you were to print it. Do a pinch-to-zoom gesture on the image preview of the email. Alternatively, you can press firmly on the preview if you’re using an iPhone.

* 4) The preview will now take the entire screen. What you are seeing is now a PDF. Tap the Share icon in the upper right corner of the screen. You can now share the PDF file generated by SMS, email, and more, or save it to iCloud Files, Dropbox, and more, depending on the apps you have installed on your device.

* 4) Once on your Desktop, you can obviously share it with someone via email, or leave it in a folder on your computer as some sort of backup.
