* Exactly one month after iTunes Match went live in the United States, Apple has started rolling out the music matching service internationally. Reports are coming in this evening that several countries now have access to the feature.
* Apple first announced iTunes Match during its WWDC keynote back in June, and then eventually launched it in early November. The service has received mixed reviews so far, and has only been available to folks in the US. But not anymore…
* Users in Canada, Australia, and Europe are reportedly receiving emails from Apple that iTunes Match is officially available in their areas. Prices for each region are being reported as such:
* “Australia – AU $34.99/year
* Canada – CAD $27.99/year
* Europe – €24.99/year
* UK – £21.99/year”
* It’s worth noting that some users are running into issues with signing up for the service. In fact, 9to5Mac is reporting that the international rollout might have been a mistake on Apple’s part. One reader even claimed he received an email from Apple regarding the slipup.
* But nevertheless, if you live in one of the aforementioned areas and have been waiting for iTunes Match to hit, it’s worth trying. You can access it by opening up iTunes (10.5.1 or later ) and selecting the iTunes Match tab on the lefthand side (hint: it’s under iTunes Store).
* Do you live in one of the above areas? How’s iTunes Match working for you?
