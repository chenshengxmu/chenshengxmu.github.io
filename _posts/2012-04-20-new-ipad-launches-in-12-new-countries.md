* As announced, the new iPad is expanding today to twelve additional countries. Meanwhile, availability of the device further eases in the United States, with the company’s online store now showing 5-7 day deliveries, an improvement over previous delivery times of between 1-2 weeks.
* Today’s expansion to twelve markets and an additional roll out to nine countries later this month will improve iPad availability to a total of 57 countries.
* As noted by The Next Web, iPad availability on Apple’s online store in the United States has been slashed to just 5-7 days:
* Other regional markets are also showing the shortened customer waiting times, including Korea and Malaysia, where the device launched today, which shows that the company is working to provide the new iPad faster than ever as it is introduced to new markets.
* Despite supply constraints at its own online store, iPads have been available at pretty much every company-owned retail store since launch. Therefore, you’ll be best served by waltzing inside an Apple Store and picking up an iPad.
* Beginning at 8am today, the tablet will go on sale in Brunei, Croatia, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Malaysia, Panama, St Maarten, South Korea, Uruguay and Venezuela.
* A week later, April 27, the device will launch in Colombia, Estonia, India, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, South Africa and Thailand.
* The third-generation iPad debuted last month in twelve major markets, including the United States, Canada and France. A week later the company brought the tablet to 24 additional countries.
* Today’s expansion to the twelve new countries and nine more later this month will increase the distribution footprint of the device to a total of 57 countries – the fastest iPad roll out yet.
* No word on availability in China yet, where Apple is embroiled in a trademark dispute with the bankrupt display maker ProView which claims it holds the right to the iPad name in the 1.33 billion people market.
* Despite this legal mess, Apple can continue to sell iPads in Shanghai.
* If you’re living in one of the countries getting the iPad today, will you be standing in line?
* Or perhaps the advertised “resolutionary” experience isn’t compelling enough an upgrade for you to take the plunge?
