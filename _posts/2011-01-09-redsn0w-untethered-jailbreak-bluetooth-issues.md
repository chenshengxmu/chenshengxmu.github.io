* One of the biggest reasons that I chose to stick with the tethered RedSn0w 0.9.6 release for my iPhone 4 is because of the beta version’s ongoing problems with Bluetooth support.
* Up to this point, all of the beta versions of RedSn0w 0.9.7 — an untethered jailbreak released by the Dev Team — have thus far been devoid of Bluetooth capabilities. When using the beta, the Bluetooth option simply stated “Not Available.”
* With the Dev Team’s latest update to the RedSnow beta, the Bluetooth hurdle has finally been eliminated, and now you can enjoy an untethered jailbreak with full Bluetooth support…
* As with all versions of the RedSn0w 0.9.7 beta, you will need to have access to development 4.2b3 firmware in order to use this jailbreak. Unfortunately, there is only an OS X version of 0.9.7b5 thus far, and you can download it from our downloads section.
* For your convenience, we have posted a full tutorial on jailbreaking your iPhone 4 running iOS 4.2.1 using the RedSn0w beta. Please keep in mind that this is still a beta jailbreak, meaning it is likely that you will still encounter bugs here and there.
* One of the few big remaining bugs continues to be incompatibility with Skype; the app crashes as soon as you try to launch it. There are also reports of incompatibilities with iBooks.
* Seeing as Skype is a heavily used app of mine, this is still a deal breaker for me. For those of you who are developers and don’t use Skype, RedSn0w 0.9.7b5 may be your ticket to untethered freedom.
* What do you think? I’m still waiting it out…
