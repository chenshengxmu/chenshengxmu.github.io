* If you’re currently rocking an iOS 6.1 tethered jailbreak on the iPhone 4 or the iPod touch 4th generation, then you have a decision to make. It’s being recommended that you go ahead and reinstall stock iOS 6.1 back on to your device, but you can, however, opt to remain as you are, and instead install a debian package that will provide the iOS 6 untethered jailbreak.
* Just as with the previous Rocky Racoon jailbreak for iOS 5.1.1, users who already have access to Cydia by means of a tethered jailbreak can “convert” their tethered jailbreak into an untethered just by installing the debian package via Cydia once released.
* Before #evasi0n reaches 100%, those with iPhone4 and ipt4g tethered 6.1 JB should now restore to stock 6.1 (but NOT if you use ultrasn0w!)

* MuscleNerd does state that the debian hasn’t been put through its paces like the app has. For that reason, if at all possible, it’s best that you jailbreak iOS 6 using evasi0n with a clean and fresh iOS 6 install. Either way, it’s good to have options, because opting for the debian route means that you won’t have to reinstall all of your cydia packages.
* Stay tuned, there’s lots more coming today.
