* The “Dream Team,” as most of you know, is made up of p0sixninja, Pod2g, MuscleNerd, and a handful of other hackers. The group is responsible for the last 2 major jailbreak releases.
* The Team was on hand to talk about those jailbreaks, at this year’s Hack In The Box Conference in Amsterdam. They discussed a wide range of topics, including Absinthe and Corona…
* What we have here is part 1 of The Dream Team’s HITB talk, which is mostly about Corona. Part 2 of the talk, which covers Absinthe and other topics, is expected to be released sometime this weekend.
* The presentation itself is a bit hard to follow, especially if you’re not familiar with the lingo. Still, it’s kind of cool to finally put voices to the people we’ve followed for so long.
* If you do happen to know what they’re talking about, and would like to find out more, all of their slides and presentation materials from the talk are available here.
* Make sure to check back this weekend for part 2 of the presentation, and feel free to give us your thoughts on this one in the comments section below.
* Big thanks to HITB founder Dhillon Kannabhiran for all of the media.
