* This year’s new Apple Watch models will feature a refreshed design, larger display, enhanced health monitoring and longer battery life. The news comes by way of a research note from the oft-accurate KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5mac).
* Kuo says the Series 4 Apple Watch will debut in the third quarter of 2018 and utilize 15% larger displays. There’s no mention of if the Watch itself will also grow in size, but given Apple’s recent obsession with thinner bezels, that seems unlikely.
* The analyst is vague with his other predictions as well, saying only that the Series 4 will feature a ‘more trendy form factor design,’ health sensors ‘other than heart monitoring,’ and a ‘larger battery capacity.’ He believes the changes will drive record sales of 24 million units in 2018,
* Since its release nearly 3 years ago, the Apple Watch has utilized the same square design and feature set—outside of performance bumps and the addition of GPS, LTE, etc. While the wearable has sold well, it definitely feels like it’s time for a major update.
