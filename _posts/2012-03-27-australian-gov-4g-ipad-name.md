* Well this isn’t too surprising. TheNextWeb is reporting that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has announced plans to file a lawsuit against Apple in the next 48 hours regarding its “misleading” iPad WiFi + 4G advertising.
* As most of you know, the wireless version of Apple’s new tablet is indeed compatible with 4G networks here in the US and in Canada. But in other countries, including Australia, the slate is limited to 3G data speeds and, if available, HSPA+…
* The ACCC believes that since the new iPad can’t connect to 4G mobile data networks in Australia, the name “iPad WiFi + 4G” is inaccurate and misleading to consumers. So it plans to take action.
* Before we go any further, it’s worth noting that Apple has added a warning to its website regarding the 4G iPad model to help clear up any confusion. It reads:
* “The iPad with Wi-Fi + 4G model can roam worldwide on fast GSM/UMTS networks, including HSPA, HSPA+, and DC-HSDPA. When you travel internationally, you can use a micro-SIM card from a local carrier. You can also connect to the 4G LTE networks of AT&T and Verizon in the U.S. and Bell, Rogers, and Telus in Canada.”
* But is this enough to keep consumers from expecting the WiFi + 4G iPad model to run on 4G networks in their home country? The ACCC doesn’t seem to think so.
* According to the report, the Commission is expected to file an application in federal court in Melbourne tomorrow, and is seeking injunctions, penalties, corrective advertising and refunds to consumers who were misled.
* What do you think? Should Apple remove the term “4G” from new iPad advertisements outside of the US and Canada?
