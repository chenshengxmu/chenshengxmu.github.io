* Ladies and gentlemen, it’s here. After much anticipation, Octopus Keyboard is now available on Cydia.
* As we first previewed a couple of months ago, Octopus Keyboard imitates the BlackBerry 10 keyboard on iOS. Be sure to check out our video walkthrough for a high level synopsis of how it works.
* Once you’ve done that, head over to Cydia, and add the necessary repo to download Octopus Keyboard now. Or you can wait a while for it to appear on Cydia’s default BigBoss repo.
* Check inside for our hands-on video walkthrough of the final version of Octopus Keyboard…
* Until the tweak hits the BigBoss repo, you can add the following repo to Cydia’s sources to download Octopus Keyboard: http://k3a.me/c/
* Be aware that you will need to purchase a license for $4.99 in order to use Octopus Keyboard. Per the developer: Once you buy your license from within the app, you can register 2 different devices every month, all future updates included.
* For those a bit weary about shelling out $4.99 on the whim, that’s completely understandable. Don’t worry though, a demo version is scheduled to hit Cydia soon.
* Be sure to let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
