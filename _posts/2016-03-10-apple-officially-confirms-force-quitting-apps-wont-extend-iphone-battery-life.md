* As our own Sebatien recently explained, force-quitting multitasking apps to save your iPhone’s battery life is a terrible idea because A) Apple is giving developers proper tools to have their apps work efficiently in the background; and B) users should trust the operating system is effectively managing apps that aren’t active.
* Today, Apple has confirmed that users should not force-quit apps frequently and has said that doing so won’t help extend the iPhone’s battery life at all.
* Responding to an email inquiry from a concerned customer, Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, has made it clear that it’s completely unnecessary to close every app in the app switcher frequently.

* “Do you quit your iOS multitasking apps frequently and is this necessary for battery life?,” asks the email sent to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who forwarded it to Federighi.

* Federighi responded, “No and No.”
* Force-quitting apps is not necessary because iOS takes care of managing system resources so that background tasks that don’t need to run do not waste resources.

* In addition, force-quitting an app removes it from RAM so the next time you switch to it iOS has to reload the app from flash storage, which consumes energy, meaning force-quitting multitasking apps on a regular basis may actually worsen battery life.
