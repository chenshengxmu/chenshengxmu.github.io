* IGN has named Telltale Game’s ‘The Walking Dead: Season 2′ it’s Free Game of the Month for August. We named the game one of our ‘Apps of the Week’ for the iPhone and iPad back in March, and it normally retails for $4.99.
* For those unfamiliar with the title, this is season 2 of Telltale’s smash hit The Walking Dead, which is based on the dark comic book series. And it follows the story of Clementine, a young girl orphaned by the undead apocalypse…

* Here’s a brief overview of the storyline:
* The sequel to 2012’s Game of the Year continues the story of Clementine, a young girl orphaned by the undead apocalypse. Left to fend for herself, she has been forced to learn how to survive in an unforgiving world. But what can an ordinary child do to stay alive when the living can be just as bad – and sometimes worse – than the dead?
* Experience what it’s like to play as Clementine, meet new survivors, explore new locations and make gruesome decisions in this five-part game series of choice and consequence.
* Just like its predecessor, The Walking Dead: Season 2 is told across multiple episodes. Episode 1 is included in this month’s deal, but after that you’ll pay $4.99 per episode (unless you opt for the 2-5 multipack, which runs $14.99).
* And here is your cinematic teaser trailer:
* Telltale describes The Walking Dead as an ‘interactive adventure,’ prioritizing cinematic storytelling over gameplay. With its sharp graphics and award-winning script, the game has been a hit across consoles, PCs and mobile devices.
* Even if games like this aren’t normally your cup of tea, I recommend grabbing it. Plus, it’s really hard to argue with free. If you’re interested, head on over to IGN’s website and grab a promotion code. The offer is available in 44 countries.
* Like deals? Be sure to check out A Dark Room and Deemo, which are also free right now.
