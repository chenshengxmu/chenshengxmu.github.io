* Just in case you missed out on the excitement last week, the high-profile Apple vs. Samsung trial ended with a bang. After 21 hours of deliberation, the jury ruled in Apple’s favor, awarding the company some $1 billion in damages.
* Since then, we’ve heard official statements from both companies. Apple, of course, is thrilled with the outcome, while Samsung says it’s a loss for the American consumer. And over the weekend, Google finally commented on the verdict…
* The Verge has the statement from Mountain View:
* “The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims. Most of these don’t relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the US Patent Office. The mobile industry is moving fast and all players — including newcomers — are building upon ideas that have been around for decades. We work with our partners to give consumers innovative and affordable products, and we don’t want anything to limit that.”
* Google is obviously trying to distance itself and its mobile operating system from Samsung’s loss, but it may not be that simple. As 9to5Mac points out, the Nexus S handset was found to be infringing on two patents in last week’s ruling.
* Remember, the Nexus devices are pure Android — no TouchWiz or other software involved. And the two patents were Apple’s “rubber band” scrolling patent, and its interface patent related to gestures, which are both software-related and system-wide.
* Yeah, if I were Google, I’d be nervous too. How long before Apple decides to go after HTC or other smaller Android partners? How long before it becomes too expensive and too risky to develop hardware for Google’s mobile platform?
