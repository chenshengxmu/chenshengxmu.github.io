* Slices is a brand new tweak that was just released on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and as we stated in this week’s episode of Let’s Talk Jailbreak, it’s a very big deal. A tweak that has sort of flown under the radar, Slices brings dual login ability and quick profile switching to many of the apps running on your iOS device today.
* Slices is especially useful for apps like Instagram and Snapchat, which don’t allow for multiple users on the same device. But it goes beyond mere login enhancements. Slices allows for multiple settings bundles, which means that you can have what is essentially multiple instances of the same game or app.
* Think of Slices as a tweak that allows you to run multiple versions of all of your favorite applications. Indeed, it’s a very big deal, as I highlight in our video walkthrough after the break.
* After installing Slices, head over to the stock Settings app to configure its preferences. Inside of the preferences, you’ll find a kill-switch, and a section for establishing slices for each user application on your device.
* Each application is allowed to have multiple slices, which can be created from the applications section of Slice’s preferences. Tap the Create Slice button to create a new slice and give it a name. After creating your desired slices, enable the Ask on Touch toggle for the application, and go back to the Home screen.

* Launch the app, and you should see a sheet appear with your list of slices. You’ll also be given a chance to create a new slice directly from this sheet. Select your desired slice, and login to your account (if applicable). Exit the app, and select your next slice, and configure that slices to your liking (i.e. logging in with a separate account).
* If you rarely need to switch slices for a particular app, you can go back in the settings and disable the Ask on Touch toggle, but it’s recommended that you keep this toggle enabled if you’ll be often switching between slices. If you turn Ask on Touch off, be sure to enable your desired default slice before exiting the preferences.
* I don’t know about you, but I’m extremely excited to finally have a tweak like this at my disposal. No longer will I be limited to just one Instagram account at a time. I can now quickly switch between accounts in mere seconds, whereas in the past, I would have had to log out of my account and log in with the new account, which took lots of time.
* Slices is available right now for $1.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. It’s not really a question to me as to whether this tweak is worth it. It is; go get it now, and let me know what you think after taking it for a spin.
