* Yesterday we told you about the secret Facebook for iPad app that was hidden inside the current, iPhone-only app. A workaround was discovered that allowed anyone to enable the official Facebook for iPad application with a few quick steps.
* Not too soon after Facebook for iPad got leaked, Facebook actually started blocking access to the hidden iPad app. Now, the jailbreak community has come to our rescue again, and we’ve got a new teak that will re-enable the secret Facebook app on a jailbroken iPad…

* FaceForward by jailbreak developer Chpwn is now available in Cydia for those wishing to re-enable Facebook for iPad.
* “Re-enable Facebook’s iPad app. Facebook recently accidentally released their iPad app, but after TechCrunch posted about it, they quickly moved to disable access to Facebook from it. FaceForward removes that restriction, allowing you to use Facebook for iPad right now.”
* To install FaceForward, you’ll of course need a jailbroken iPad. To jailbreak the iPad 2, follow these steps. For the iPad 1, you can use RedSn0w. For both devices, you should be on iOS 4.3.3.
* Once you’ve got a jailbroken iPad with the Facebook for iPhone app installed, head over to Cydia and install FaceForward for free from the BigBoss repo. You shouldn’t have to tweak any settings or edit any files. FaceForward will simply enable Facebook for iPad!
* Let us know if this trick worked for you! Do you like Facebook for iPad?
