* Waze, a Google-owned community-based traffic and navigation app, today rolled out a new feature called Planned Drives which lets you schedule a drive and get a reminder to leave on time, based on live traffic conditions.
* In addition, the traffic bar in Waze 4.3 for iOS now shows the reason for a jam, like an accident or object on the road, and the app now mutes automatically during an incoming or outgoing phone call.
* By entering the time and date you need to arrive, the app will take care of the rest, recommending the best time to leave. You’ll also receive a reminder closer to your event with an updated departure time based upon real-time road conditions.
* To get started, launch Waze and enter your destination address in the search bar. On the Waze ETA panel, click the new Waze Planned Drives icon in the bottom left.
* A new screen will open, showing peak traffic hours along your future route. Wade’s estimates take into account expected traffic conditions based on the app’s smart algorithms, aggregated traffic history and predictive analysis.
* Planned Drives launches today on iOS and will be coming to Android soon.
* Waze requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* The app is localized in English, Afrikaans, Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Norwegian Bokmål, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Traditional Chinese and Turkish.
* Grab Waze at no charge in the App Store.
