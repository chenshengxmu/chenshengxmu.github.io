* iPhone X is the first iPhone rocking a display that can be awoken with a tap, which lets you quickly check notifications, take photos, use widgets on the Lock screen and more.
* The problem with Tap to Wake is that it makes it all too easy to wake your iPhone X with a simple tap, especially if you didn’t mean to do that.
* Over time, those accidental taps may even drain up the handset’s battery faster than usual because Tap to Wake, after all, requires a small portion of your battery juice to function.
* Thankfully, you can disable Tap to Wake.
* Before we get to it, it’s worth reiterating that the instructions in this tutorial are not applicable to other iPhone, iPad or iPod touch models because Tap to Wake is exclusive to iPhone X.
* 1) Launch the Settings app.
* 2) Tap the section General.
* 3) Tap the sub-section Accessibility.
* 4) Slide the Tap to Wake switch to the OFF position to turn the feature off.

* Now when you lock your iPhone X and try tapping the display, nothing will happen.
* The user experience doesn’t change much without Tap to Wake because your iPhone X will still automatically wake the Lock screen when you pick up the handset to look at it.

* That feature, known as Raise to Wake, is available on any iPhone model from iPhone 6s onward and can be turned on and off at will in Settings → Display & Brightness.
