* Heads up gamers, Telltale Games is currently offering the first episode of ‘The Wolf Among Us’ for free right now. We named the game one of our ‘Apps of the Week‘ for the iPhone and iPad back in February, and it normally retails for $4.99.
* For those unfamiliar with the title, The Wolf Among Us is a violent, mature thriller based on the award-winning Fables comic books. It’s made by the same team behind The Walking Dead, and features similar decision-making gameplay mechanics.

* Like the Walking Dead, the story of The Wolf Among Us is told across multiple episodes. Episode 1 is included with the game, which you get for free, but after that you’ll pay $4.99 per episode (unless you opt for the 2-5 pack for a 25% discount).
* Even if you’re not normally into games like this, I recommend grabbing it. Both the production value and gameplay mechanics are very impressive—especially for this price. Those interested can find The Wolf Among Us in the App Store for free.
* Also keep in mind that Telltale is still offering episode 1 of ‘Walking Dead: The Game – Season 2’ for free.
