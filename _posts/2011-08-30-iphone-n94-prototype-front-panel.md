* Leaked iPhone components and parts have been surfacing recently, with the most recent prototype part relating to the allusive iPhone ‘N94’ prototype.
* Rumors have been that the next iPhone will feature a larger screen with an edge-to-edge bezel, but this prototype leak indicates a LCD display completely identical to the iPhone 4. It’s believed that the N94 prototype will be a cheaper model very similar to the iPhone 4, and the lower tier device is expected to rely heavily on iCloud for storage and streaming.
* Yesterday, we showed you what we believe to be the back panel of the iPhone 4S, and this N94 prototype leaks also seem to be synonymous with a cheaper ‘4S’ device. This leaked front panel matches up nicely with the back frame we’ve already seen — both parts look almost identical to the iPhone 4.

* Macpost reports:
* “The LCD part is clearly labeled as N94 “EVT1″ (Engineering Verification Testing) with date ’03-March-2011′. Whilst, the white front cover posted few days back was labeled “EVT2″ with date ’07-June-2011′. Since these are marked as N94 EVT1, the images are definitely of next generation model.”
* Engadget also got these parts, and both reports seem to match up. The form factor of these N94 parts strongly suggests the rumor of a cheaper, second iPhone model to be released alongside a completely redesigned iPhone 5 this Fall. The iPhone 4S, internally prototyped as the N94, looks to have the same 4 inch display as the iPhone 4. The iPhone 5 will most likely be the device to have a different screen size, with the good possibility of an edge-to-edge bezel design.
* Rumors say that the iPhone 5 will have a metal chassis with a new display and faster internals. This N94 device looks to be the retooled iPhone 4 that Apple is gearing towards the cheaper smartphone market.
