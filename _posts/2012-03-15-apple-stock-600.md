* It would seem as if Apple could do no wrong these days. It recently introduced a new tablet that, even though it has yet to officially go on sale, has created quite the buzz among consumers. And its stock has just hit an all time high.
* At the end of February, AAPL was flirting with the $550 per share mark. But it fell back down below $520 just before the new iPad was unveiled. Ever since then, however, the stock has been on an unstoppable upward climb…
* Apple shares touched just above $600 this morning, once again setting a record high for the company. It seems to be doing that a lot lately.
* We’re not sure what’s more impressive, the fact that AAPL is flirting with the $600 mark. Or the fact that it is doing so just 30 days after crossing $500 per share for the first time. Even if you don’t follow the stock market, you know that’s insane.
* Analysts have already started raising their 2012 projections for the company to over $700 a share. And some are even predicting it to approach $1000 by this time next year.
* Fun fact for the day: At $1000 per share, Apple would be worth around a trillion dollars. That’s right, a trillion.
