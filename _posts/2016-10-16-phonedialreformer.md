* You can now change the look and feel of your iPhone‘s dial pad buttons inside the Phone app with a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed PhoneDialReformer.
* You can use this tweak to mess around with the roundness and corner radius of the dial pad buttons until they match your own personal tastes.
* After you install PhoneDialReformer, you can open the Settings app and launch the tweak’s preferences pane:

* There’s not a whole lot to configure here. There’s just a toggle switch to enable or disable the tweak on demand, as well as a slider to adjust the amount you want to reform the buttons by.
* The slider can be used to choose a value between 0 and 25. As you move the slider, it changes the shape and corner radius of the dial pad buttons. We’ve found that setting the slider to somewhere in the middle yields the best visual results.
* Changes are immediate, so you don’t need to respring every time you make a change. Nevertheless, we recommend killing and re-opening the Phone app any time you make changes for the best results.
* The effects are only cosmetic, so you can still use the dial pad in exactly the same way you’ve been using it even before using the tweak. If you’re into themes, this tweak could help you get the different look you’re going for to better match your device’s theme.
* If you want to try PhoneDialReformer, you can download it on your jailbroken iPhone for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. As it requires the Phone app, this will not work on the iPod touch or iPad.
