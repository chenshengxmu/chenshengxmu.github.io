* Nintendo is scheduled to debut Super Mario Run, its platformer optimized for one-handed gameplay, on the App Store on December 15. Ahead of this eagerly anticipated release, the Japanese gaming giant released a live-action commercial that’s all about speed.
* Running two minutes and five seconds long, the ad features people from all walks of life running across scenic locations and in front of landmarks across the globe. The video features an upbeat tune and classic Super Mario notes and sound effects.
* Here’s the ad.
* Also watch the gameplay video from Nintendo included below.
* To make the wait for Super Mario Run a tad more bearable, you can visit your local Apple Store and test-drive Super Mario Run for yourself. If you don’t have the time to go to the nearest Apple Store, check out my colleague Andrew’s quick hands-on video embedded below.
* Nintendo has said that Super Mario Run will require a persistent Internet connection to help prevent piracy, which could potentially spell trouble for those with a poor Internet connection or a metered data plan on their iPhone.
* The game will be free to download, but lifting limitations from the three built-in modes will require a one-time $9.99 In-App Purchase upgrade. Feel free to sign up on the App Store to be notified when Super Mario Run drops and download the official iMessage sticker pack to adorn your conversations with Super Mario Run stickers.
* Learn more about the game at the official website.
