* KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo issued a note to clients this morning, obtained by MacRumors, in which he predicted that Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 would manage to squeeze a Plus-sized battery into a smaller 4.7-inch form factor, possibly having even better battery life than a 5.5-inch LCD iPhone.
* This will be achieved by utilizing a pricier stacked logic board design—also known as a substrate-like PCB (SLP) mainboard—that would create additional space inside the device to accommodate a significantly larger battery.
* The design should permit Apple’s engineers to squeeze a Plus-sized battery inside a device with a power-sipping, edge-to-edge OLED display and having similar dimensions to a 4.7-inch iPhone.
* Here’s a passage from Kuo’s report:
* As battery material tech isn’t likely to see major breakthroughs in the next 3-5 years, mainboard area can only be reduced via stacked SLP, which makes space for larger battery and extended usage time.
* Thanks to stacked SLP, we expect the OLED iPhone to have similar dimensions to a 4.7-inch LCD iPhone, and have comparable battery capacity (equipped with around 2,700 mAh L-shaped 2-cell battery pack) to a 5.5-inch LCD iPhone.
* Were iPhone 8 to use a battery similar to that inside 5.5-inch iPhones, that’d be a 50 percent power boost versus a 4.7-inch device. In fact, iPhone 8 could have even better battery life compared to the 2,900 mAh battery inside 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus models.
* That’s because the phone will switch to an OLED display which is significantly more energy efficient than its LCD counterpart as it doesn’t need a backlight. The stacked mainboard design could result in up to 80 percent higher manufacturing costs for the component, supporting thesis that iPhone 8 will have a premium price tag of $1,000+.
* The analyst speculated that the iterative LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus upgrades may not use stacked mainboard design, meaning their battery life could be comparable to the current iPhone 7 family.
* Assuming Kuo knows what he’s talking about, his note could serve as yet another indication that iPhone 8 will indeed feature an all-new design with an edge-to-edge display and no or minimal “chin,” a relatively large area below the display.
* KGI’s report comes just as Apple has officially joined the Wireless Power Consortium amid rumors that iPhone 8 would include wireless inductive charging, based upon the Qi standard overseen by the consortium.
