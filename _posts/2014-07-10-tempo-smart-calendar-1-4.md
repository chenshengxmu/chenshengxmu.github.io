* Available free of charge in the App Store, Tempo 1.4 adds several long-expected features like Waze integration for community-based traffic reports, native support for iOS Reminders, more timely notifications for flights and conference calls, updated contact details on Profile Cards and more.
* Perhaps the biggest new feature, Tempo 1.4 now lets you add events in plain English. The app will parse your spoken query and recognize the days of the weeks, time, holidays, repeating events and more. Jump past the fold for the full list of changes…
* Tempo sets itself apart from other calendar apps on the App Store by implementing advanced features that turn it into an assistant which can anticipate what you need and surface that information right in the calendar, when you need it most.
* By eliminating the need to use multiple apps to cull relevant emails, find contact information, notify attendees if you’re running late or get directions to your next event, Tempo does more in one tap, so you never miss a beat.
* In addition to integration with iOS Reminders and Waze, a refreshed UI and personalized emails to help users prepare for their workweek, the all-new natural language processing engine is no toy.
* It actually leverages sophisticated AI and semantic technology from SRI International, the startup behind the personal assistant app Siri that Apple acquired.
