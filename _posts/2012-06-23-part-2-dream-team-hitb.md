* Yesterday, we showed you part one of the Dream Team’s talk at this year’s Hack In The Box conference. The section covered the exploits that were used in Corona, and other A4 jailbreak details.
* Part two of the talk went live today, and in our opinion it’s much more interesting. In it, the Team discusses the A5 jailbreak, and throws in a nice little ‘one more thing’ announcement at the end…
* Even if you don’t understand most of the stuff they’re talking about in the video, you’ll want to watch the last minute or so (the 51:30 mark to be exact). The Dream Team announces that it has completed work on the iOS 5.1.1 jailbreak, and the audience erupts.
* Regardless of what you think of the presentation, you have to admit these guys are seriously talented. Here’s hoping that they continue to stick around the jailbreak community for many, many years.
