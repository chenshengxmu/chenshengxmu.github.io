* Anyone who said you had to deal with a boring still wallpaper on your Mac was crazy; well… kind of.
* Using just your Terminal app that comes pre-installed in macOS and a special command, it’s possible to set your favorite Mac screensaver as your wallpaper for a temporary period of time.
* In this short and easy tutorial, we’ll show you exactly how that’s done.
* From the Terminal app, you can use a command to set your Mac’s current screensaver as the wallpaper for as long as the Terminal app is running the command.
* This does mean the change isn’t permanent, but it’s still a cool thing to do and can help you keep the screen’s pixels moving for the most part while you’re idle without having your Mac go full-screen with the screensaver instead.
* Having said that, here are the steps to set your screensaver as your wallpaper (as temporary as it may be):
* 1) Launch the Terminal app on your Mac and enter the following command, then press the Return key on your keyboard to activate the command:
* /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background

* 2) Keep the Terminal app running for as long as you want this screensaver to remain on your Desktop as the wallpaper.
* When you quit the Terminal app, or use the Control + C keyboard combination, the wallpaper will return to its normal wallpaper image.
* We covered this screensaver a while ago – my screensaver is an animation created by Ramus Neilson called WatchOSX based off of the Apple Watch face and it keeps time accordingly. It’s free to download and comes with a variety of different watch faces to choose from.
* Of course, this Terminal command works with any screensaver, whether it’s one that comes with your Mac out of the box, or a third-party screensaver you’ve downloaded and set up on your Mac.
* This Terminal command is more of a party trick than a permanent solution, since it won’t actually keep the screensaver as your wallpaper forever, but it’s still a cool concept. Perhaps some day in the future, Apple will enable live wallpapers on the Mac so we can have movement right on our Desktops.
