* Units of the staggeringly-expensive Apple Watch Edition began shipping this week, and some customers have already started receiving their orders. Yesterday, a user over in this MacRumors forum thread posted a series of photos showing his new golden wearable.
* The photos are of a 42mm Yellow Gold Edition with black Sports band. The box looks similar to that of the Stainless Steel Apple Watch, but is dark blue (almost purple) in color and includes a matching cleaning cloth. Check out the images below to see more differences.

* In addition to the photos, a proper video unboxing has also surfaced on YouTube (via 9to5Mac):

* The 18K Gold Apple Watch Edition starts at $10,000, essentially 10x that of the most expensive Stainless Steel model, and goes all the way up to $17K. That doesn’t count the Edition with gold Link bracelet spotted on various celebrity wrists, which likely costs much more.
