* RedSn0w, the popular jailbreak tool by the Dev Team, has been updated with support for a tethered jailbreak on the iOS 5 developer beta. It’s been less than a week since Apple got iOS 5 Beta 1 into the hands of developers at WWDC and across the world, and a tethered jailbreak is already available.
* The news was announced by Dev Team frontman, MuscleNerd, and version 0.9.8.b1 of RedSn0w is now available to download for those with access to the iOS 5 beta. To get the iOS 5 beta legally, you must have a registered developer account with Apple.

* Dev Team,
* “WWDC 2011 is winding down to a close, and developers of jailbroken apps for Cydia are probably itching to get started on all the iOS 5 goodness.  It seems like a good time to release the tethered redsn0w jailbreak for iOS 5.”
* The following devices are supported:
* Some warnings for those of you with access to the iOS 5 beta:
* “There are just too many broken components (Apple’s official apps, 3rd-party App Store apps, Cydia apps, MobileSubstrate apps, etc) for this to be useful to anyone but those truly looking to fix bugs in their iOS 5 jailbroken apps. (Seriously!)”
* Obviously, you must have access to the iOS 5 beta and have the IPSW downloaded to your computer for this jailbreak. There’s actually a way to get iOS 5 without a developer account, but you’ll have to figure that out on your own.
* To jailbreak with RedSn0w, follow our instructions here. The steps to the tutorial have not changed. We will not be providing download links to iOS 5, because you should have it already if you are a registered developer. You can, however, download the newest version of RedSn0w from our iPhone downloads page. It is Mac-only.
* The Dev Team has made it sound like this RedSn0w jailbreak will continue to be usable in upcoming iOS 5 betas. That’s good news.
* “The way redsn0w works, you will very likely be able to use this on upcoming iOS5 betas, just by continuing to point redsn0w at the 5.0b1 IPSW.  So keep that IPSW handy!”
* If you’re an Apple/Cydia developer, let us know how this tethered jailbreak works on iOS 5.
