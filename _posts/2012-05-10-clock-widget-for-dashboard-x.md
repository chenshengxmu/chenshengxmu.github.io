* Clock Widget is a simple Android inspired widget that’s great to use if you like to hide the clock in your status bar like yours truly.
* I see this as being more or less of a way to show off the potential of Dashboard X, as it was created by the developer of Dashboard X himself.
* Check out our video walkthrough for more info…
* Clock Widget is actually the first Dashboard X widget to find its way on Cydia; it was promptly followed up by Dashtweet, which was released a short while ago.
* This is a widget that’s not going to knock your socks off, but it does give us a sneak peak of what we might come to expect in the future.
* Clock Widget is a free download from Cydia’s ModMyi repo, but it does require a $1.99 Dashboard X in order to install it.
* What do you think?
