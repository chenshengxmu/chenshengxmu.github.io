* Hot on the heels of Apple’s blowout quarterly earnings report this afternoon, 9to5Mac is reporting that Tim Cook has sent an internal email out to Apple employees regarding the company’s success.
* In the memo, Cook congratulates his team on a record-setting quarter and thanks them for all of their hard work on Apple’s new iBooks initiative. He also asks the employees to join him for a special meeting tomorrow at Apple’s Town Hall…
* 9to5Mac has gotten its hands on, and published, the email:
* “Team,
* Thanks to everyone’s hard work, we’re off to a great start in 2012. Last week in New York we launched a groundbreaking initiative for education with iBooks textbooks, and today we reported the strongest quarter in Apple’s history. Please join me tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. in Town Hall. We’ll review our record-setting results and discuss some exciting new things going on at Apple. The meeting will be broadcast live to many sites in Cupertino and other Apple locations. Please check AppleWeb for details.”
* While the “discuss some exciting new things going on at Apple” line is intriguing, we’re not going to read too much into it. Given Apple’s secretive history, it’s very unlikely that Apple would unveil any kind of future product plans to employees.
* Nevertheless, we’ll let you know if we hear anything exciting from tomorrow’s event.
