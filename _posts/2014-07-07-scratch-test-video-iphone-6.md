* Hot on the heels of this morning’s bend stress test video of an alleged iPhone 6 sapphire cover, comes a clip of a scratch test further showing the part’s durability. YouTuber Marques Brownlee has gotten his hands on an alleged 4.7-inch iPhone 6 cover and put it through its paces.
* In the video, Brownlee tries to snap the sapphire cover in half by bending it, but is unable to do so. He also takes a set of keys and even a large folding knife to the component in an effort to scratch the display cover, but again he is unsuccessful. We’ve posted the full video below…
* Apple typically uses Corning’s Gorilla Glass to cover its iOS device displays, but was largely rumored to replace it with sapphire crystal following last year’s announcement that that the company would be opening up a new sapphire product plan in Mesa, Arizona with GT Advanced.
* There are many advantages to sapphire crystal, as it’s a very high quality material and very thin. It’s also extremely durable, as you have seen in the recent videos, and thought to be virtually un-scratchable. As Brownlee notes in the above clip, “it eliminates the need for a screen protector.”
* It was reported at one time that the sapphire display covers would be limited to the larger 5.5-inch version of the iPhone 6, but this part’s existence rebuffs that claim. The iPhone 6 is expected to launch in September with higher resolution displays, an A8 processor and other improvements.
