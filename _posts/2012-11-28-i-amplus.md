* Fans of iPhone photography have a field day with today’s news of the brand new 500px for iPhone app and a significantly reimagined Vimeo iOS build. So, remember hip-hop artist and the Black Eyed Peas leader Will.i.am announcing a 14-megapixel iPhone camera attachment last week?
* Today, we learn that the accessory bearing his name and dubbed the i.am+ is set to launch December 6. It’s gonna be available in contemporary and vintage version for the iPhone 4/4S, with the flagship iPhone 5 unit arriving at some point next year and sporting a dedicated 14-megapixel camera sensor and flash…
* According to U.K.’s Telegraph, the contemporary camera attachment will retail for £199, or approximately $317. The pricier vintage models will cost £299, or a whopping $488. Each will be available for the iPhone 4/4S and iPhone 5 and respectively called C.4 and V.4 and C.5 and V.5.
* The white V.4 model has an unmistakable vintage feel to it and also comes with a physical slide-out keyboard.

* If you’re not a fan of that pimped gold trim, maybe the more modern i.am+ C.4 is for you?

* A companion app will interact with the accessory, letting you share individual snaps via your free account on the i.am web service. The software will feature on-screen controls to quickly switch between shooting modes, apply real-time filters control the built-in flash, edit pictures, add captions and more.
* The difference between the iPhone 4/4S and iPhone 5 version is that the former accessory uses the device’s camera, while the iPhone 5 attachment features its own 14-megapixel sensor and flash. That’s why the iPhone 4/4S versions will ship with interchangeable lenses for standard, fish-eye and photo zoom features.
* Does that thing look like something you’d gladly add to your photographer’s toolkit?
