* Recently, major news outlets all but confirmed that the next iPhone will be announced on September 12 and become available on September 21. Aligning nicely with that piece of information, a new report based on industry sources claims that carrier AT&T is planning to launch the iPhone 5 during the third or fourth week of September.
* Moreover, the carrier apparently told its retails staff it has rescheduled a large training event for regional employees from the first week of October in order not to clash with a “huge announcement”…
* Boy Genius Report editor Jonathan Geller has some quality sources when it come to telcos, writing in an exclusive story:
* According to a trusted AT&T source, the carrier is currently planning to launch Apple’s next-generation iPhone during the third or fourth week of September, with an all-hands-on-deck policy in place for employees that will extend through to the middle of October.
* With less than four weeks left until the anticipated announcement, I’m wondering whether or not you’ll be upgrading to a sixth-generation iPhone?
* I know I will.
* Hopefully it’s gonna be the mother of all upgrades.
