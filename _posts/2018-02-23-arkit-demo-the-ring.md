* As The Verge points out, Singh isn’t the first developer to have recreated this famous scene from “The Ring” using Apple’s ARKit augmented reality framework.
* Mike Woods, for instance, has created an equally impressive “The Ring” demo using Apple’s ARKit framework. “I made ‘The Ring’ in ARKit, and showed it to my kids,” he said.
* Check out his video embedded right below.
* Not only does Samara come out of the TV screen, she also follows the user around the room and shows up in hallways. I wish someone made an ARKit-powered shooter where demonic creatures would chase me down the hallway.
* How do you like this scary ARKit demo?
