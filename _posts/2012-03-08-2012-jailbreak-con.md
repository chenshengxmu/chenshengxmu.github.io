* The folks behind MyGreatFest, the world’s first jailbreaking convention, have just announced that they have confirmed the date and location for its 2012 event: JailbreakCon.
* Jailbreakers, tweak developers and iOS hackers will be gathering at the South San Francisco Conference Center in — you guessed it — San Francisco, California, on September 29th.
* And wait until you see this list of guest speakers…
* Even though WWJC (World Wide Jailbreak Convention) is still 6 months away, several prominent hackers and developers have already committed to attend.
* All of these folks are either slated to speak at the event, or host hands-on workshops. Wow. Even if you’ve only been jailbreaking for a few weeks, chances are you recognize most, if not all, of the names on this list.
* If you’re wondering what to expect from JailbreakCon, we have a good roundup of last year’s event. Ticket pricing and availability for this year’s conference aren’t up yet, but, as an official sponsor, we’ll be sure to let you know when that happens.
* So, who wants to go to JailbreakCon 2012?
