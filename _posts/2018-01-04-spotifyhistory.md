* Spotify is one of the most popular alternatives to Apple Music for media-streaming on iOS, but it lacks a history list for seeing what you’ve listened to in the past.
* If you’ve been itching for a way to change that, then you might find a new free jailbreak tweak called SpotifyHistory by iOS developer Andreas Henriksson helpful. It brings a full-featured music history list to iOS‘ official Spotify Music app.
* SpotifyHistory begins jotting down your music history from the moment you install the tweak. You can access your music history from inside the Your Library tab, which can be found at the bottom of the app. It’s in here that you’ll find the shortcut for History.
* SpotifyHistory displays your history in the order you’ve listened to the tracks with the most recent at the top. There are, however, some things you should know about SpotifyHistory’s functionality.
* For one, the tweak only saves music tracks to your history if you listen to them for longer than 10 seconds. Additionally, repeated tracks won’t appear in your history list more than once.
* Regarding controls, you can do the following:
* Keep in mind that SpotifyHistory only works with the Spotify Music app. According to the developer, the tweak works on all jailbroken devices running versions 8.4.31 and 8.4.34 of the Spotify Music app. If you’re not already using Spotify Music, then it’s a free download from the App Store.
* Given just how useful a running history can be, we can’t recommend SpotifyHistory enough. The tweak can be had for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Note: For those interested, SpotifyHistory’s source code is available on GitHub.
* Do you think having the history list in your Spotify Music app is a good idea? Share why or why not in the comments section below.
