* It’s finally here, folks! Comex has released the highly anticipated JailbreakMe 3.0, code named Saffron. The web-based jailbreak works on all iDevices, including the iPad 2, on iOS 4.3.3, and iOS 4.3.3 only for the time being.
* This userland jailbreak is super easy to perform straight on your iDevice, and Comex’s PDF exploit will give you an untethered jailbreak for the iPad 2 via Mobile Safari.
* Head over to JailbreakMe dot com to jailbreak your iDevice with the new tool. A huge thanks is due to Comex and the beta testers that have been working hard on this project for months.
* Despite Comex’s exploit leaking online this past weekend, JailbreakMe 3.0 has prevailed and is now available for everyone to use in Safari on iOS.
* According to the Dev Team, so far, JailbreakMe Saffron is compatible with:
* Comex has said that iOS 4.2.1, 4.3.1, and 4.3.2 should be added to JailbreakMe 3.0’s compatibility list at a later date.
* We already have a JailbreakMe tutorial ready and a video walkthrough for you guys should be up very soon, so stay tuned. In the meantime, happy jailbreaking!
* Let us know how JailbreakMe 3.0 works for you in the comments below.
* Update: And JailbreakMe.com is now down again. Apparently Comex had to fix something for the jailbreak to run smoothly. Check back soon!
* Update 2: And it’s back! Good luck
