* Apple has just added a new basketball drama series from Kevin Durant’s media company and Imagine Entertainment’s Brian Grazer to their roster.
* The new series, Swagger, will be based on Durant’s time playing basketball in Washington, DC during his childhood.
* It will also touch on the youth-sports economy where families have to make tough choices on whether to cash out early, or plan for the long-haul.
* So excited to partner with Imagine and Apple on this series…much more to come @richkleiman @thirtyfivemedia https://t.co/ZC21fSkXIe

* Kevin Durant confirmed the news, originally reported by Deadline, on Twitter.
* Brian Grazer, who is also involved, founded Imagine Entertainment with his long time friend Ron Howard. Grazer has won several awards for his TV and movie productions.
* The project will be written and directed by Reggie Rock Bythewood from Thirty Five Media, Kevin Durant’s new media company.
* This is just the latest media project for Apple, with many others already in the works.
* Apple has taken a split approach on its media projects, with some straight-to-series orders, and others being developed for straight-to-series consideration. Swagger will be joining Are You Sleeping and Little America in taking the latter route.
* What do you think of Apple’s latest potential series? Would you watch? Let us know below.
