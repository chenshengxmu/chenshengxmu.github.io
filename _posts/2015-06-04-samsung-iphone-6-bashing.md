* In a pair of new television commercials, Samsung is back at what it does best: bashing Apple’s iPhone. Promoted under the tagline “six is greater than six,” the 30-second videos highlight three features of Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge: wireless charging, a wider-angle lens on the selfie camera out the front and a curved screen which displays tidbits of information across the edges of Samsung phones.
* I’ve included both ads for your viewing pleasure.
* The latest Samsung device comes outfitted with built-in wireless charging capabilities. “The iPhone 6—not so much,” proclaims the voiceover.
* The ad proceeds to take us on a quick tour of the Galaxy’s front-facing camera which takes wide-angle selfies “that fit everybody,“ as opposed to the iPhone 6’s camera which “just cut off nana”.

* The other ad touts the Galaxy S6 Edge’s curved screen that can displays colors when your favorite contacts call. “The iPhone 6 displays nothing, but it has a vibrate function,” the ad remarks sarcastically.
* The edge of the Samsung smartphone displays various bits of information when the phone is lying face down on a table, such as texts, news, sports, weather, Twitter, email and more, “while the edge of this guy has buttons”.
* Someone please remind Samsung of their prior iPhone bashing which revolved around the Galaxy’s removable battery and a port for memory cards as these features are nowhere to be seen on their latest flagship.
