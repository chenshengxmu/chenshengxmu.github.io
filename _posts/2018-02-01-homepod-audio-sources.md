* There has been some major confusion lately regarding what Apple’s HomePod wireless speaker can and cannot play.
* Thankfully, Apple has now updated HomePod’s technical specifications with a new Audio Sources section providing a handy list of all the audio sources that HomePod supports at launch, as first noted by MacRumors:
* As confirmed by iMore’s Serenity Caldwell, HomePod also works with your personal music collection in your iCloud Music Library via Apple’s iTunes Match service, but Siri may be unable to interact with any of your uploaded tracks that lack appropriate metadata.
* Apple started taking pre-orders for the $349 wireless speaker last week ahead of its scheduled launch on February 9 in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. The accessory will launch in Germany and France in the Spring.
