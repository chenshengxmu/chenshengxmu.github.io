* Apple has begun accepting donations for the American Red Cross to help with the Harvey storm relief efforts, allowing its customers to make donations in $5, $10, $25, $50, $100 and $200 increments via a special page on iTunes.
* Like with its previous efforts to collect money for good causes, this initiative uses the iTunes billing mechanism. The donation will appear on your credit card statement as an iTunes Store transaction. Your iTunes Store credit cannot be used to make a donation.
* According to Apple, 100 percent of proceeds will go to the American Red Cross.
* Because your personal or payment information won’t be shared wit the the organization, they’re unable to further acknowledge your donation beyond an email receipt from iTunes Store, which will serve as the only record of your donation.
