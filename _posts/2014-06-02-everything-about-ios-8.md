* Apple just finished up with its huge WWDC keynote, and we’re still sorting through the madness. The company introduced a number of new developer tools and two new platforms (HealthKit and HomeKit), as well as new versions of OS X and iOS.
* We’ve covered a lot of the new iOS 8 features individually, but given the sheer amount of things announced today, we thought it’d be helpful to create a roundup of everything you need to know about the update, which will publicly launch this fall…
* These are the major new iOS 8 features Apple talked about today, and there are several more it didn’t cover. If you’re a registered developer, you can download the iOS 8 beta now, otherwise you’ll have to wait until it officially launches to the public this fall.
