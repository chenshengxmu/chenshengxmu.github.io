* As announced earlier today, you can now pre-order your iPad directly from Apple for delivery on March 16th.
* The iPad 3 comes in several flavors. Black, white, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, Wi-Fi or LTE. Fortunately for your wallet, prices remain similar to what they’ve been for the last two years…
* The entry level model will cost you $499, while a 64GB LTE model will set you back $829.
* Go to Apple to pre-order your iPad 3 today. The site might is probably getting slammed with traffic, so don’t be surprise if it is slow or unresponsive.
* Are you going to pre-order or will you wait in line? What model are you going to get?
