* During its ‘hello again’ event on Thursday, Apple showed off a new 27-inch 5K LG UltraFine display. SVP Phil Schiller described it as the “ultimate docking station” because it has multiple Thunderbolt 3 ports, and can even charge the new MacBook Pro.
* Schiller also noted that Apple teamed up with LG to build the display specifically for the new Pro, so it’s unclear what the future is of Apple-branded displays. There have been rumors it’s building one, but it may have decided the numbers aren’t there.

* Here are the full tech specs:
* And here is a blurb about the display from Apple’s website:
* With a stunning 5120-by-2880 resolution and P3 wide color gamut, the 27-inch LG UltraFine 5K Display brings your favorite photos and videos to life. So whether you’re watching a movie or editing an image, this high-performance monitor delivers immaculate 5K resolution for even the most pixel-packed visuals.
* A single Thunderbolt 3 cable (included) provides up to 85W of charging power to your MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports. And three downstream USB-C ports (5 Gbps) offer additional connectivity and power to compatible devices and accessories.
* Built-in stereo speakers, camera, and microphone deliver a rich media experience. And with over 14.7 million pixels, you won’t miss a single detail of your next design layout, photo edit, or FaceTime call.
*  
* The LG UltraFine 5K display is pricey at $1,300, and Apple says it won’t be available until December. There is also a 21-inch 4K version of the UltraFine, which has a resolution of 4096-by-2304. It’s priced at $700 and starts shipping in 5-6 weeks.
