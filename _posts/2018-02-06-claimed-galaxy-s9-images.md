* Purported press photographs of the next-generation Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus smartphones have leaked ahead of Samsung’s official unveiling at Mobile World Congress on February 25, a day ahead of MWC’s start.
* The images were tweeted out yesterday by prolific smartphone leakster Evan Blass. One of the shots suggests Samsung will offer its next flagship in a new color, called Lilac Purple. Other color options will apparently include Midnight Black, Titanium Gray and Coral Blue.
* The phones should be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 chip in the United States or Samsung’s own Exynos 9810 processor in other territories. Galaxy S9 is said to include 4GB of RAM while the Plus model should use 6GB of RAM.

* The phones appear to end up looking just like the current Galaxy S8 series, save for a few subtle design tweaks. There is no Home button and we’re not expecting a Face ID-like biometric system either (aside from Samsung’s usual 2D facial recognition system, iris scanning and a back-mounted fingerprint sensor).
* The nearly fullscreen Infinity display is still there, as are the minimal bezels and a bunch of sensors. Samsung recently teased unspecified camera advances for the Galaxy S9 series with an invite for the official unveiling featuring the text, “Camera, reimagined.”

* According to a recently leaked Galaxy S9 retail box, the Plus-sized device should include a vertical dual-lens setup on the back with a Dual-Pixel 12-megapixel rear camera with optical image stabilization capable of shooting 1,000 images per second and paired with a second 12-megapixel camera with a fixed aperture.
* The regular-sized Galaxy S9 should have a single 12-megapixel camera with variable aperture from f/1.5 to f/2.4. Galaxy S9 should sport a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED Infinity display while the Plus model may boast a 6.2-inch Quad HD+ (2960 × 1440 pixels) Super AMOLED panel.
