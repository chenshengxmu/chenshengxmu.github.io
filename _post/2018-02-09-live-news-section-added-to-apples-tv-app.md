* As promised back in September at the launch of the Apple TV 4K, iOS and tvOS users are now able to tune in to live news from several sources in the TV app.
* This follows the launch of the dedicated sports section just a couple months back. The News section is a bit more limited, living inside of the Watch tab, rather than earning its own.
* The News section gives users quick access to live news through CBS News, CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg, Cheddar, and Fox News.
* Just like with the Sports section, when you tap on a live feed, it takes you directly to that network’s app. If you don’t have that app installed, it will prompt you to install it.
* If you use Single Sign-On, it will use those credentials to log you in automatically, making the whole process seamless.
* If you have an Apple TV, you can even ask Siri to “Play Bloomberg” and it will jump to the live feed of that network.
* You can check out the News section for yourself if you have an iOS or tvOS device running 11.2.5 or later.
* Let us know what you think, down in the comments. Do you still use the TV app?
