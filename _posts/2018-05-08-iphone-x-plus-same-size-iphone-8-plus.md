* Apple’s rumored Plus-sized iPhone X model should pack an OLED display measuring 6.5 inches diagonally into a chassis roughly the same size as the current iPhone 8 Plus model.
* The fairly reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara reportedly learned yesterday (Google Translate) from a “reliable supplier information source” that so-called iPhone X Plus with its 6.5-inch OLED display will be 0.2mm thicker than the current 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus due to the “mounting form” of its vertical dual-lens rear camera (the infamous camera bulge).
* By comparison, iPhone 8 Plus is 7.5mm thick and iPhone X measures in at 7.7mm thick. In other words, iPhone X Plus will be no thicker than the current iPhone X model. The rumored device should also feature an edge-to-edge OLED screen with slimmer bezels, no Home button, the TrueDepth camera system for features like Face ID, Animoji and so forth.
* As for a second-generation iPhone X, it should retain its 5.8-inch OLED display and body while implementing a larger camera sensor and larger lens for improved photography features.
* Finally, Mac Otakara claims Apple’s third iPhone model this year will sport an LCD display that will be slightly smaller at six inches rather than the reported 6.1 inches diagonally.
* The LCD phone should feature Face ID support, too. Additionally, iOS 12 should bring support for horizontal Face ID unlock that was reportedly designed to work on the upcoming TrueDepth camera-equipped iPads, and likely iPhones.
* Feel free to comment on this rumor by sharing your thoughts in the comments.
