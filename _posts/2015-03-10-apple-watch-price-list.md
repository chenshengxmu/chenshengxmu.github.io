* If you’re planning on buying one of Apple’s Watches, be prepared to spend a significant amount of time on research due to the dizzying array of price points based on the different models, sizes and bands.
* Choosing between the Apple Watch models and two sizes is the easy part.
* But the rich choice of bands and the fact that not every band is offered across all Watch models and sizes makes choosing a combination that suits your tastes and — more importantly — fits your budget something of a mind job.
* To help you make sense of a total of forty different sales combinations, we’ve put together a handy price list based on the confirmed models, sizes and bands.
* As mentioned above, Apple is offering a range of different straps for the Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition.
* While Apple Watch Sport prices are the same regardless of the bands available for that model, going with a higher-end Watch entails factoring in prices of the different bands being offered.

* For instance, the stainless steel Apple Watch can cost anywhere between $549 and $1,049 for the smaller 38mm version, or between $599 to $1,099 in the case of the larger 42mm model.
* As for the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition, the price range is even more pronounced because most bands offered for that device have gold parts.
* For instance, while the entry-level 38mm Apple Watch Edition with White Sport Band costs ten grands, opting for a Bright Red Modern Buckle brings the price up to an eye-watering $17,000.

* Taking into account all of the available options yields the following price points across the there Watch editions, two sizes and band choices:
* For your convenience, the Apple website lists all Watch models.
* Another (recommended) way of researching all the Watch options at your disposal is Apple’s Apple Store shopping app, available at no cost in the App Store.
* Has Apple provided too many choices, do you think?
* Or, do these SKUs make sense from a personalization point of view given that users will be wearing a fashionable device on their wrist all day long?
