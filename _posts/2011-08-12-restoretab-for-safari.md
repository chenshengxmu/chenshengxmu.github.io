* Don’t you just hate it when you accidentally close out a tab, desktop browser or otherwise? Thankfully, most desktop browsers include provisions to quickly restore a closed tab in an instant. With mobile browsers, however, it’s a matter of going back through your history.
* That’s about to change. Actually, that has changed. Introducing: RestoreTab for Safari — a jailbreak tweak that lets you quickly restore your previously open tabs.
* And that’s not all; it’s a bit more than just restoring your previous tabs, as you’ll notice in this video walkthrough…
* The cool thing about RestoreTab for Safari, is that not only does it restore your previously opened tabs, but it restores their full back/forward history as well. This will allow you to efficiently locate a specific page in the history of a recently closed tab.
* Interested? RestoreTab for Safari is available for jailbroken iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. It’ll set you back about $0.99.
* If you’ve given it a whirl, let me know how you think it performs in the comments below.
