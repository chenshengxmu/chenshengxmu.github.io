* As we count the remaining minutes until Apple’s iPhone 5S/5C keynote (85 minutes left and counting), the blogosphere has spent the last 48 hours putting together some downright amusing parody videos (not mentioning a few in really bad taste).
* While hardly meant to downplay Apple’s inevitable domination in headlines today, we’re not complaining – such parodies have long become part of the Apple keynote folklore. Now, some watchers may be expecting a revolution.
* Realistically –  this morning is about two phones, both based on the existing iPhone 5 design: a mid-range model redesigned around a much cheaper and sturdier plastic enclosure and an S-upgrade with a faster chip, better camera and Touch ID sensor.
* Check out the videos after the break and hit us in comments…
* The following is an elaborate parody which borrows heavily from the familiar concept seen in Apple’s product video tours. It argues in a non-insulting manner that nobody can touch Apple’s level of deception.
* I’ll take that one as a compliment.
* The (un)official iPhone 5S keynote movie-like trailer is also brilliant, starring Tim Cook, Jony Ive and Phil Schiller.
* Kudos to TechRadar for putting the clip together!
* Finally, we have Andy Media’s take on the gold iPhone 5S commercial.
* I’m not sure about the last one, but the top clip had me floored.
* Don’t forget, today we should also get our first hint at what Tim Cook will have to apologize for on 9/23.
