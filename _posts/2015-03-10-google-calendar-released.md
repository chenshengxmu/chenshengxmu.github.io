* As promised in November, Google today released a new Calendar app for iPhone. The app features the company’s highly regarded Material Design UI, and a host of powerful features that should appease folks in the Google ecosystem.
* Among those features is its close integration with Gmail, allowing it to cull data from your inbox. So say you receive a confirmation email after purchasing concert tickets, the app will automatically add that event to your calendar.
* You can find Google Calendar in the App Store for free.
