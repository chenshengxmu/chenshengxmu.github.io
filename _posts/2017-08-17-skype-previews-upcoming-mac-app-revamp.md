* Microsoft today announced availability of Skype Preview for Mac and non-Windows 10 PC users, highlighting some of the features recently launched in Skype for iPhone that are coming soon to its desktop apps for Mac and Windows computers. 
* Featuring bolder Apple Music-like headings throughout the interface, a new notification panel, a media gallery and enhanced group calls with support for in-call reactions and real-time screen and photo sharing, this is Microsoft’s attempt to tidy up Skype’s interface on desktop.
* The following features are available in Skype Preview:
* Available from Skype Insider, the app installs alongside Skype classic so that you can easily switch back if needed, but avoid running them both at once so that you don’t get duplicate notifications for messages or calls.
* Some of these features began rolling out today to Skype for Windows 10.
* Grab Skype Preview for non-Windows 10 PCs and Macs today from Skype Insider.
