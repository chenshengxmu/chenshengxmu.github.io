* In this week’s edition of our Apps of the Week roundup we have an app that pays you to walk, a photo editor that brings your still images to life and an AirBnB for clothing and accessories. And as usual, we’ve selected two great new games for you to check out.

* Walk, share, earn rewards. Jaywalk is an app that rewards you with discounts at local merchants for walking around town, sharing content and interacting with other users in your local area. You can accumulate credits throughout the day and redeem them when you shop at any participating merchant in your neighborhood. The app tracks your location and steps via Apple’s HealthKit, so you do have to give your consent for that, otherwise this seems like a great excuse to go walking around town this weekend.

* Chances are you’ve heard of Enlight, the brilliant photo editor by Lightricks, but you may not be aware that there are multiple spinoff apps under the Enlight brand. Pixaloop is one of them, and it’s an app that lets you magically bring your still photos to life through animation. Make a fire glow, give your water photos waves, and even turn your dark background into a rolling night sky. Animate a single element of your photo, or several. I will say that I’m not a huge fan of Enlight’s use of IAPs, but the UI is sharp and the effects are awesome, which makes it worth checking out in my book.

* I like a good weather app or todo list manager as much as the next person, but I also like apps that try out new concepts all together. That’s why I selected Wear Wardrobe for this week’s roundup. It’s essentially AirBnB for clothing (the more high-end stuff, not your favorite T-shirt). You can select clothing items and accessories from someone you would like to rent, or you can have others pay you money to rent your stuff. It’s only available in New York City at launch, but I’ll be interested to see how (or if) this grows.

* Four Seconds may be the most simple, straight-forward game we’ve ever posted. The only UI elements are a timer and a button, and all you have to do is tap the button when the timer shows exactly 4 seconds. It’s a quick-twitch type of game that may not be as easy as it looks. See you on the leaderboards!

* Ok, maybe I spoke too soon. Cube Cube! is also a very simple, minimalistic game. It falls in the runner genre, so it’s sort of like Temple Run, but without the elaborate graphics. In fact in this game, you are essentially a square running over a flat line and jumping over triangles and other basic shapes. This actually makes for a pretty sharp design and addictive gameplay. It’s also surprisingly challenging—only 1% of players make it through level 10.
