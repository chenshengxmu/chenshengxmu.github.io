title: Star Wars Pinball landing late-February
---
* If you can’t get enough of Star Wars and have been yearning for something a bit more challenging and entertaining than Rovio’s Star Wars-themed Angry Birds, here’s some good news. Zen Studios Games has been hard at work putting finishing touches on their officially licensed pinball game dubbed Star Wars Pinball.
* The trailer above highlights the Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back table which takes place – you guessed right – on the main deck of a Star Destroyer. Clearly inspired by the events of the film, it includes such memorable characters as Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, plus the inevitable battles with AT-AT Walkers and Tie Fighters…
* Graphics are crisp and the concept sounds promising.
* They’re also using voices from the Empire Strikes Back movie.
* Mark’s “That armor’s too strong for blasters” exclamation sounded a bit weird to me, but I suspect the team had to do a lot of editing to filter out background noises and music from the movie.
* Note how upon spelling out “STAR WARS”, the game offers five different scenes to play through before finally activating the Wizard mode to confront Darth Vader himself.
* This is an announcement video from a week ago.
* The first pack of tables will include Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Boba Fett and Star Wars: The Clone Wars.
* “Each table features a different iconic moment from the Star Wars universe, with interactive 3D characters, and unique gameplay,” developers promise. They are planning a total of ten themed pinball tables in the Star Wars Pinball collection.
* The game is set to debut later this month on a variety of platforms, including Google’s Play Store for Android, Windows PCs and Apple’s Mac App Store and App Store.
* Star Wars Pinball will also be available as downloadable content for Pinball FX2 on Xbox LIVE Arcade and Windows 8, Zen Pinball 2 on PlayStation Network for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita as Cross-Buy entitled content.
