* Talking to sources, 9to5Mac has put together a list of key experts Apple’s hired and assigned to its rumored car thing, code-named Project Titan. The project is led by product design Vice President and former Ford executive, Steve Zadesky.
* Another big hire is Johann Jungwirth, President & CEO, Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America.
* He specializes in integrating smartphone functionality and developing advanced user experiences. All told, the Cupertino firm is reportedly is assembling a thousand-people team under Zadesky. Hundreds of them are from an automotive hardware background and were hired recently or around the time Tim Cook reportedly approved the project.
* Here are some of them.
* Here are, I think, five of the most important hires that I cherry-picked from the nearly two dozen executives mention in the article:
* Lauren Ciminera. Formerly Tesla’s Lead Recruiter, she now hires away automotive experts from other companies and lures them into Apple.
* As you can see for yourself, these are all A-players with years of experience in direct car manufacturing, vehicle research and automotive design. And just like Apple has hired medical experts to help create the Watch’s fitness and health tracking features, the scope and the skill set of these hires strongly indicate that the firm is researching a vehicle of its own rather than simply extending its CarPlay software platform.
* The Apple Car story began growing legs earlier in the month, when the press discovered a handful of unmarked minivans driving around California with roof-mounted camera equipment, leased to Apple.
* Here’s a video footage of Apple’s mysterious minivan testbed that AppleInsider captured Monday, possibly revealing more detail on its equipment while showing at least two people who man the vehicles during testing operations.
* The story quickly took a different spin after headlines mentioning an Apple-branded vehicle started appeared in last week’s editions of The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
* While The Wall Street Journal asserted that Project Titan is an electric vehicle, Reuters described it as an autonomous self-driving car.
