* Adobe MAX: The Creativity Conference officially kicked off today, where the Photoshop maker showcased its new Creative Cloud apps, including a next-generation Lightroom and all-new photography plans for customers to take advantage of.
* Lightroom is being rebranded “Lightroom Classic CC” because the updated Lightroom CC has now become a cloud-based photography service and an app ecosystem that’s deeply integrated and works seamlessly across desktop, mobile and web.
* “By separating the two products, we’re allowing Lightroom Classic to focus on the strengths of a file/folder based workflow that many of you enjoy today, while Lightroom CC addresses the cloud/mobile-oriented workflow,” notes Adobe.
* The new photography plans now come with additional features tailored for mobile workflows.
* While Lightroom CC for iOS received a number of important new features today (they continue supporting Lightroom Classic), Lightroom CC on desktop is now a completely new app for Mac and Windows PC computers.
* It comes with a new interface that makes it easy to organize and edit from the same streamlined experience, with your original images, edits and metadata seamlessly synced and stored in the Creative Cloud in full resolution, including RAW photos.
