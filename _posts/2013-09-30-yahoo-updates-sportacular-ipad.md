* Right now is a great time to be a sports fan. College and pro football are in full swing, and we’re on the verge of post-season Major League Baseball and the beginning of the 2013-14 basketball season.
* And with so much going on, it’s nice to have a sports app around to help you keep up with everything. And while there are several, Yahoo is hoping its big 4.2 update for Sportacular Pro will win you over…
* Here are the 4.2 release notes:
* Big update: – Redesigned with more content, stats and iPad support. – Sign in to Yahoo to save your favorite teams across web and mobile devices.  – View your Yahoo Fantasy Football player stats on game details. – New breaking news alerts for the most important stories in sports.  – iOS7 fixes for favorites, alerts and picks. You may need to reset your favorites if you have already upgraded to iOS7.
* NOTE: Facebook chat is no longer supported.  
* Having played with Sportacular Pro both before and after the update, I’m still not convinced it’s worth the $5 price tag. ESPN has a solid free offering, and Yahoo’s own free ‘Sports’ app is plenty capable.
* Still, if you’re invested into Yahoo’s ecosystem, the update is worth grabbing—iPad and single sign-in support are great. For those interested, you can find Sportacular Pro in the App store for $4.99.
