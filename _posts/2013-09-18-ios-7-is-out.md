* Like clockwork, Apple has just released the long anticipated iOS 7 software update. Packed with innovative new features and rocking the controversial Jony Ive-approved user interface overhaul, the seventh iteration of Apple’s mobile operating system for iOS devices is now available to owners of the iPhone 4 and later, iPad 2 and later, iPad mini and fifth-generation iPod touch.
* Building on its predecessor, iOS 7 comes packed with new features such as Control Center, AirDrop wireless file sharing, Vimeo and Flickr integration, ad-supported iTunes Radio, FaceTime audio calls and more. It also improves upon the existing feature set with such stuff as enhanced alerts, the improved Notification Center, smoother multitasking, improvements to Siri, Safari, Photos and many other stock apps…
* It appears to be the same build as the iOS 7 Gold Master, so there’s no need to restore if you already have GM.
* To apply an over-the-air update, go to Settings > General > Software Update.
* Apple’s servers are being slammed. If you can’t download iOS 7 now. Try again a little later
