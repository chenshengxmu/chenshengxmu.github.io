* After three years, countless episodes, and more than a billion downloads, some say Angry Birds is getting long in the tooth. Sure, the game gets updated with new levels and themes, but you’re still essentially flinging birds at pigs.
* Good news though, it looks like Rovio is getting ready to flip the script a bit with its long-rumored spinoff. The studio recently set up a pair of ‘Bad Piggies’ Facebook and Twitter accounts, and just uploaded this teaser trailer…
* Sure enough, this looks to be the pig game we heard about back in July. Here’s an excerpt from that post explaining the premise:
* “The idea of the new game will see you trying to protect the eggs you’ve grabbed from the birds, but still feature a catapult and the now famous wooden and stone structures.”
* There’s little information regarding the game on the Facebook page, other than the same “Something PIG is coming” mantra you see in the above clip. But given the pre-holiday release date we’ve been hearing, and the fact that Rovio is starting to heavily advertise the title, we assume it won’t be long before it’s downloadable.
* In fact, a September-October release would be perfect timing, as Apple is said to be unveiling a slew of new devices starting September 12.
* So, what’s your take on this pigs spinoff game?
