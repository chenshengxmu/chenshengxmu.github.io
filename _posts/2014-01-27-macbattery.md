* MacBattery is a brand new jailbreak theme that allows you to add an OS X inspired battery indicator to the status bar in iOS 7. The theme uses the Alkaline jailbreak tweak in order to modify the battery indicator without having to rely on WinterBoard. We already reviewed Alkaline in an earlier post last week.
* If you’re looking to switch up the look of your iOS 7 device’s status bar, then Alkaline coupled with MacBattery is a good place to start. Have a glance at our full video walkthrough inside.
* Once you install MacBattery, you’ll need to head to Alkaline’s preference inside of the stock Settings app. If you don’t already have Alkaline installed, MacBattery will install it as a prerequisite.
* After enabling MacBattery you’ll be asked to respring your device. After respringing, you should see the new Mac inspired battery indicator in the status bar.

* As you’ll no doubt note, MacBattery is a pretty faithful rendition of the battery indicator found in OS X’s menu bar. If you’d like to give it a shot, you can do so free of charge via Cydia’s ModMyi repo.
