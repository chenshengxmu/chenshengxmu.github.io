* According to a new report from Japanese blog Macotakara, the next-generation iPhone may see some radical design changes. Citing ‘reliable sources,’ the publication said that the handset will feature rounded edges, a curved glass display, and an all-aluminum rear shell. 
* More specifically, the report says that the iPhone 6’s display will be slightly curved in order to accommodate the new rounded edges. It even goes so far as to liken the device’s profile to the Japan-made Squair Curvaceous Bumper [above], an aluminum bumper for iPhone… 
* It’s worth noting that Macotakara has a fairly solid track record in Apple intel, and many of the details it’s reporting match up with previous chatter—in November, Bloomberg reported that the company was working on two new iPhones with large curved screens for 2014.

* The rounded-edge design is also something we’ve heard before, as is the all-aluminum backing. The latter, if true, would be a particularly impressive feat, as Apple would have to rebuild its entire antenna system in order to get rid of the current glass ‘antenna’ windows.
* Anyway, unless everything we’ve seen thus far has been hokum (quite possible), we’re starting to get an idea of what to expect visually from the iPhone 6: a larger display, thinner profile and more rounded edges. The device is expected to launch as early as September.
* Earlier today, a video surfaced comparing an alleged iPhone 6 case to a Nexus 5, iPhone 5s and Samsung’s gigantic Note 3.
