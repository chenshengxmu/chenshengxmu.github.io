* The iPhone 4S hasn’t even been available for more than a day, and a drop test has already made its way around the internet.
* Like the iPhone 4, the iPhone 4S sports a beautiful glass and metal design. When dropped on its screen, the iPhone 4S proves its mortality…
* A word to the wise: don’t intentionally drop your iPhone, ever. It’s just plain stupid. And if you’re clumsy, get a case.
