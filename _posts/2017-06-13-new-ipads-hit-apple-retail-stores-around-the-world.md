* If you’re in the market for a shiny new tablet with an Apple logo on it, the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro model and a second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro are now available for purchase at company-owned retails stores around the world.
* The tablets were announced at last week’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose and feature Apple’s in-house designed A10X Fusion chip, Apple’s brightest display ever with True Tone technology, a whopping 120Hz refresh rate they’re calling ProMotion and other features.
* Along with the new tablets, Apple is also offering a leather case for Apple Pencil which prevents rolling and broken tips.
* You can buy your iPad either at a nearby Apple Store or purchase it online, via the “Buy iPad Pro” webpage, and have it optionally delivered to a nearby Apple Store for pickup.

* The new 10.5-incher is available from $649 and its bigger brother starts at $799.
* Add an extra $130 if you’d like an LTE-enabled model. The devices come in 64/256/512GB capacities and in Gold, Silver and Space Gray color finishes. The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro also comes in Rose Gold, unlike the 12.9-incher.
* It’s worth keeping in mind that these new tablets ship with iOS 10.3. iOS 11, which really unlocks the full iPad potential, will release as a free update for everyone this fall.
* Are you planning on upgrading your tablet computing to one of the latest iPads?
