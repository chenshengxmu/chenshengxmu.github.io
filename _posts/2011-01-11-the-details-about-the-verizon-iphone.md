* As expected Steve Jobs didn’t show up this morning to introduce the Verizon iPhone. Instead, his #2, Apple’s COO Tim Cook shared the stage with Verizon COO Lowell McAdam.
* Tim’s minute talk was quite disappointing. He clearly was here to make this look more legit, sharing a few basic facts about the Verizon iPhone (Retina Display, A4 chip, FaceTime, App Store, etc…) but didn’t share any technical information.
* Now let’s have a closer look at what we know from the Verizon iPhone…
* At this point it still isn’t clear if there will be a Verizon iPhone 5 this summer. It’s also quite not clear if the antenna has been improved or not.
* The question on everybody’s mind was “what happens when you’re browsing the web and receive a phone call?” Well, data connection drops and your phone starts ringing. In other words, you can’t make a phone call while browsing the web. Although it’s definitely not a deal breaker, especially to Verizon customers who are used to it, I can see this being a minor issue for nerdy people like me.
* On February 3rd, Verizon existing customers will be able to pre-order the iPhone 4 on Verizon. On February 10th, everyone will be able to get it either from Verizon or Apple, both online and in stores.
* Just like the AT&T’s iPhone 4, the 16GB version will sell for $199, while the 32GB version will sell for $299. It comes with a 2-year contract.
* A nice easter egg indeed… Mobile hotspot will be included for up to 5 devices. Bye bye MyWi.
* In conclusion, nothing really groundbreaking was unveiled today. The iPhone 4 is coming to Verizon for the same price as it is on AT&T. As expected, data and talk won’t be happen at the same time.
* Now I’d be curious to know if there’s going to be a SIM card slot for international travelers but I assume we’ll find out about it quickly.
* Questions? Concerns? Feel free to sound off in the comments section.
