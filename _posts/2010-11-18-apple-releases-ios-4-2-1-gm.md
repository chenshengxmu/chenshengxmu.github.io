* No iOS 4.2 for us today, unlike many sites were wrongly reporting, mostly based on a rumor that started as a joke. Instead, Apple released iOS 4.2.1 GM to developers.
* iOS 4.2 should have already shipped to the general public but a last minute bug pushed out the release. We’re likely to see iOS 4.2.1 released to everyone sometimes next week…
* Let’s be patient. Thoughts?
* [9 to 5 Mac]
