* HomeKit, Apple’s platform for the connected home that was unveiled last summer, is beginning to pick up support from some well-established names in smart home appliances.
* Last week, several vendors brought out some compelling HomeKit-certified home automation devices ahead of the Worldwide Developers Conference. And now, HomeKit is going to get a lot smarter with support for new types of home automation systems and improved remote management of your home.
* In addition to the existing crop of device types for the connected home, HomeKit in iOS 9 will support many more types of sensors to make your connected home smarter, including windows shades, carbon monoxide sensors, motion sensors and even dedicated security systems.
* Additionally, you will be able to access and manage your home via iCloud.
* It should be noted that the current crop of HomeKit appliances can be managed remotely through the Apple TV acting as a HomeKit hub, or via a dedicated HomeKit hub device.
* We’ll report more about the improved HomeKit in iOS 9 as soon as more information becomes available so stay tuned to iDownloadBlog for continued coverage throughout the day.
