* Micro-blogging platform Twitter on Thursday announced a full suite of targeting, creative and measurement tools that enable Twitter advertisers to promote their mobile apps, both on and off-Twitter.
* One particular native ad unit takes advantage of Twitter Cards and Promoted Tweets technologies to allow users to easily install and engage with apps, directly from their Twitter timeline.
* Currently, tapping an App Store link in a tweet in Twitter’s free iPhone and iPad application opens the link in an in-app browser which then redirects the request to the App Store app. Direct app installs from Twitter timelines is limited to this new ad unit and it’s not clear if Twitter plans on enabling the feature for common app store links in people’s tweets…
* According to Twitter, its new mobile app promotion suite taps MoPub’s mobile advertising exchange that reaches a 1 billion unique devices and handles more than 130 billion ad requests monthly inside Android and iOS apps.
* “Advertisers can now choose to run simultaneous marketing campaigns to more than 241 million active users on Twitter, and to more than 1 billion mobile devices off-Twitter, through one interface at ads.twitter.com,” wrote the firm.
* These campaigns will then run across the Twitter Publisher Network and are automatically translated into programmatic bids on the MoPub exchange.
* Here’s an example of a Kabam ad on The Twitter Publisher Network.

* The ability to interact with and install mobile apps directly from the Twitter timeline should boost engagement and drive app downloads.
* The feature is available to U.S. advertisers in a private beta and is currently being tested with early launch partners like Spotify, HotelTonight, Kabam, Deezer, SeatGeek, Gree, GetTaxi (“the engagement rates are remarkable”) and others.
* You can download Twitter’s iOS app free in the App Store.
