* It’s here, folks. iOS 4.1 for iPhone is available for download. The iOS 4.1 software update is the first major update to iOS 4, bringing Game Center, new iTunes features, high dynamic range photography, and more to the iPhone.
* To get the latest iOS 4.1 software, simply plug your iPhone in iTunes and search for update, or save it to your computer from our iPhone downloads section.
* As usual when a new firmware version comes out, jailbreakers and unlockers should stay away from it. As we reported this morning, updating your jailbroken or unlocked iPhone to 4.1 will make it impossible to jailbreak/unlock your iPhone, at least for the time being.
* Have you downloaded iOS 4.1 yet? What do you think? Please share your first impressions in the comment box below.
