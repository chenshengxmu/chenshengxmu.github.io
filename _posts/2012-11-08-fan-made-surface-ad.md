title: Fan-made ad teaches Microsoft how to advertise the Surface against the iPad
---
* Instead of a boring teaser, the weird Movement commercial, a meaningless self-made drop test clip, cheesy making-of footage and a whole bunch of other all too easily forgettable videos, maybe Microsoft should have employed the talent of Forest Gibson? The guy clearly has a better idea of how to position Microsoft’s Surface tablet against the iPad juggernaut…
* Apple’s iPad mini commercial served as a nice starting point for Gibson’s concept ad.
* To be honest, I’m not really sure which one I like better.
* You?
