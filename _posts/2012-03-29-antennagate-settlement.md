* Remember Antennagate? As you know, a settlement was reached in the class-action lawsuit concerning the signal attenuation issue stemming from the iPhone 4 antenna design. The settlement includes Apple issuing a free iPhone bumper case or $15 to eligible iPhone 4 owners in the United States.
* In case you don’t want a free bumper case for your device, you can now register for a $15 cash payment at the official Antennagate class action settlement website which has just gone live. As always, there are some caveats worth pointing out…
* Co-lead counsel Ira Rothken announced on Twitter that the affected customers in the United States wishing to make a claim can do so at the iPhone4Settlement.com website now. This is only valid for the folks who did not pick up a free bumper case for their iPhone 4.
* Also, note the fine print:
* To be eligible for the cash payment, you must have: (a) experienced antenna or reception issues; (b) been unable to return your iPhone 4 without incurring any costs; (c) been unwilling to use a case or free bumper for your iPhone 4; and (d) completed certain troubleshooting steps or are unable to complete the troubleshooting steps because you no longer own your iPhone.
* If you meet the above criteria, the settlement will provide a $15 cash payment if you are a United States resident who are or were the original owner of an iPhone 4.
* Also, pay attention to these important dates and deadlines as well.
* You are limited to one cash payment.
* It’s worth remembering that class members can continue to request a free bumper case, per Apple’s requirements outlined in this support document.
* Did you pick up your free bumper case already or are you planning to register and get your $15 cash payment?
