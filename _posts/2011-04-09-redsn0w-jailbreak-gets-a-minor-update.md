* The Dev Team has recently updated their RedSn0w jailbreak to version 0.9.6rc12. According to MuscleNerd, RedSn0w 0.9.6rc12 should fix any lingering issues with the boot logo animations, which some of you had issues with.
* So, what to do if you already jailbroke with RedSn0w and want to fix this boot logo issue? Simply download RedSn0w 0.9.6rc12 from here and run it over your current jailbreak, but make sure you do not select to install Cydia…
* That’s it. It shouldn’t take you more than a few minutes. When you’re done, make sure to install the iDB boot logo.
* If it’s your first time jailbreaking or if you’re not sure about how to use RedSn0w, please refer to our RedSn0w jailbreak tutorial.
