* A week after Apple pushed iOS 9 to the public, it has followed up with the release of iOS 9.0.1. As you may have guessed by the version number, iOS 9.0.1 is a bug fix update. All users running iOS 9 should therefore update to iOS 9.0.1 for increased system stability.
* Perhaps most notably, we saw several users in our comments talk about failed upgrades, where iOS would freeze when using the Slide to Upgrade feature in the Setup Assistant. That issue should now be solved thanks to iOS 9.0.1.
* Here is the change log for the iOS 9.0.1 release:
* To initiate the update, connect to iTunes and check for update via the device summary page, or use the OTA update feature on your iOS device found in Settings → General → Software Update.
* Have you been suffering through any of the aforementioned bugs? Does iOS 9.0.1 fix your issues? Sound off down below in the comments and let us know.
