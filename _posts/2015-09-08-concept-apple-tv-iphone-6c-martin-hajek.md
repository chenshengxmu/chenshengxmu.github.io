* Ahead of Apple’s big unveiling tomorrow, 3D artist Martin Hajek has posted a batch of sexy concept renderings which imagine Apple’s rumored iPhone 6c and a next-generation Apple TV with iPhone 6 and Apple Watch design cues plus iOS 9-powered UI.
* Contrary to the rumors, Apple won’t be unveiling the iPhone 6c tomorrow after all though some tipsters claim the device is coming in time for Thanksgiving.
* With iPhone 6-like design and rumored features such as an A8 chip, NFC, Touch ID and Apple Pay, the iPhone 6c should eventually help streamline Apple’s lineup with consistent design and certain key features shared across various screen sizes.

* “Size does matter, but a smaller iPhone 6s… Now that would be interesting,” Hajek said.

* In addition to the rumored late-2015 release date, some supply chain sources have cautioned against expecting the iPhone 6c this year, saying the device is being readied for a 2016 release.

* For this concept Hajek has teamed up with fellow 3D designer Andrew Ambrosino who helped imagine a much sleeker Apple TV borrowing design cues from both the iPhone 6 and the Apple Watch.

* As for the next Apple TV’s rumored remote with a touchpad and built-in microphone for Siri voice control, the designers have especially put an emphasis on gaming so they imagined a remote with controls on both sides.
* “How about that Apple TV gaming rumour you ask? Just flip the remote over and game on,” they wrote.

* I’ll admit his vision appeals to my inner gamer though I’m just not so sure about that glowing Apple logo…

* According to people briefed on Apple’s plans, the next Apple TV runs iOS 9 with a dedicated App Store with downloadable apps and games and a totally revamped user interface.

* The new Apple TV experience would start with an iOS 9-like Lock and Home screen. As shown above and bellow, the revamped Home screen would show the date/time and feature a configurable background.

* This is what browsing an Apple TV App Store with downloadable apps and games would look like in the designers’ vision.

* Notice the Daily Show with John Stewart running as you’re browsing the App Store? That’s because the next Apple TV is said to include an iPad-inspired picture-in-picture feature allowing you to watch live television as you browse the device.

* And here are Apple Watch-like Glances on a big screen TV. “Swipe up on the new touchpad remote for glances,” reads the description.

* “Swipe left and right through multiple glances. Press to enter the full app.” If you swiped the glances down, you would be taken back to the Home screen.
* And of course, as the next Apple TV is said to run iOS 9, tentpole features should include stuff like Siri voice control, Proactive and Universal Search.

* “Press the new search button and you’re presented with Siri,” they explain. “Before you search, Siri shows you ‘Proactive’, the new iOS 9 feature that suggests relevant next steps.”

* At any rate, these concepts are quite compelling as the current Apple TV interface overwhelms users with Home screen icons and is a big mess when it comes to efficient navigation.

* How do you like these concept images so far?
