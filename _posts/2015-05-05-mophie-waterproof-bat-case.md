* On Tuesday, California-based accessory maker Mophie announced its first ever waterproof battery cased called the “Juice Pack H2PROTM.” The case is made for the iPhone 6, and features a durable design to protect against drops, dust, dirt and of course, water damage.
* The battery pack included in the case is of the 2,750mAh lithium-ion variety, which will allow users to enjoy up to 14 hours of additional talk time, 10 hours of web browsing and 50 hours of music. Mophie says overall, the H2PROTM more than doubles iPhone battery life.
* “Once again we’ve successfully broadened our product line by focusing on mobile users’ everyday power and protection concerns,” said Mophie CEO Daniel Huang. “The juice pack H2PROTM serves as a protective safety net for those who encounter life’s unexpected mishaps.”

* In addition to waterproofing, the new Juice Pack also features Mophie’s ‘Priority+TM’ charge and sync tech. This enables pass-through charge and sync while connected to a Mac or PC, and ensures that when your iPhone is in the case, it receives a charge before the Juice Pack.
* The Mophie Juice Pack H2PROTM for iPhone 6 is currently available for pre-order at mophie.com for $129.95. If you’re looking for a battery case for your iPhone 6 that doesn’t need to be waterproof, you may want to check out the highly-rated Anker UltraSlim 2850mAh.
