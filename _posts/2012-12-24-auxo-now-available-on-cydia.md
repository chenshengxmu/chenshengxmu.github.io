* Ladies and gents, it has landed. Yes, Auxo, the highly anticipated jailbreak tweak that reinvents the iOS app switcher has gone public on Cydia.
* Last week we brought you an exclusive first look at the tweak in action, and needless to say, nearly 200,000 views later, many of you are looking forward to trying it out for yourselves. If you have a jailbroken iPhone running iOS 6, I’m happy to report that you can now download Auxo from Cydia’s BigBoss repo for just $1.99.
* Of course, there are a few prerequisites that you must keep in mind if you would like to try Auxo. First, Auxo is iPhone/iPod touch only at the moment.  The developers assure me that an iPad version is in the works, but it hasn’t finished baking yet, so stay patient iPad owners. The description in Cydia states that the iPad version of Auxo should be available in early 2013.
* Secondly, you must be running iOS 6 in order to use Auxo. Yes, there is a 5.x version of Auxo that’s currently being ported, but just like the iPad support, it’s not quite there yet. If you don’t want to give up iOS 5.x, and would like to try Auxo, then my suggestion is to just be patient. There could possibly be a very short turnaround period between the iOS 6 only release, and the iOS 5.x release. In the details for the tweak on Cydia, the developers state that the port to iOS 5.x will be completed next week.
* The last prerequisite is perhaps the most obvious of them all — your device must be jailbroken in order to install Auxo. As on of now, iOS 6 is only capable of being jailbroken on a handful of devices — the iPhone 4, the iPod touch 4th generation, and the iPhone 3GS. So, obviously that means that you can only run Auxo on any of the three aforementioned devices. Again, as of this post, you can only run Auxo on the iPod touch 4th generation, the iPhone 3GS, or the iPhone 4. To reiterate, these must be running iOS 6, and they must be jailbroken using the steps outlined in our RedSn0w jailbreak tutorial.
* If you meet the criteria, then congratulations, you can now install Auxo. Head over to Cydia, and you should see it pop up on the changes tab. If you’ve just jailbroken your device to install Auxo, then it may be best to search for the tweak using the Search tab instead. Once downloaded and installed, you may follow our video walkthrough, or read the excellent User Guide that comes bundled with the tweak via the iPhone’s Settings app.
* As you could no doubt tell from my video walkthrough, I was extremely excited about Auxo. I’m happy to tell you that the excitement I showcased hasn’t worn off at all. Auxo truly is a step in the right direction for the stock iOS app switcher. It affords a much better view as to the context of running applications, it features handy multi touch swipe gestures to remove apps from the switcher, and it features redesigned music controls. As bonus, you also get toggles to help you manage often used items like Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity.
* Apple has made a habit out of “borrowing” the ideas and concepts revolving around popular jailbreak tweaks, and implementing them directly into stock iOS. Obviously, its decision to do this is controversial, especially for the developers that have spent many hours perfecting their creations. With that said, if there’s one thing that Apple pilfers in its next revision of iOS 7, we can only hope that it’s Auxo.
* Have you been able to try Auxo yet? After using it for yourself, what do you think? Does it live up to the publicity that it’s garnered? Sound off with your thoughts and ideas in the comment section below.
