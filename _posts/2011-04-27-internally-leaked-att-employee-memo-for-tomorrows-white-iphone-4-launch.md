* The folks at ModMyi have gotten their hands on an internally leaked memo from AT&T that outlines the protocol for tomorrow’s white iPhone 4 announcement. Apple confirmed that the white iPhone was finally launching on AT&T and Verizon tomorrow, and demand is expected to be substantial for the device.
* AT&T’s customer protocol for tomorrow’s launch reveals some interesting details about the upgrade policy. If you’re planning on waiting in line, this memo also pertains to you…

* ModMyi reports,
* “The document contains a list of “Critical Must Knows/Dos for Local Dealer Locations.” The highlight of all this confidential information is the fact current iPhone 4 users still under the 30 day BRE policy can exchange their current black iPhone 4 for a brand new white one. The exchanged device must be “in like-new condition with no visible damage.” Of course any restocking fees apply.”
* The white iPhone 4’s pricing will remain the same as its black counterpart, including a hefty $449 and $549 early upgrade fee.
* Here are some more instructions from AT&T to its employees,
* Quote: “Due to the unprecedented demand for White iPhone 4, our inventory is running low. I cannot guarantee there will be product available“
* Sounds like a pretty typical launch for an Apple device. If you plan on being one of the first to pick up the white iPhone tomorrow, make sure to get there ahead of time so you don’t get stuck in line. There has been no indication of a huge turnout for tomorrow’s launch, but stores in large cities may have lines.
* Once you do get your white iPhone 4, make sure to take it home and jailbreak it.
* Who’s getting the white iPhone tomorrow? Do you expect any lines?
