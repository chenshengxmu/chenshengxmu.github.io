* Reuters is out with a report this evening regarding the production timeline for Apple’s iPhone 6. Citing local media sources, the outlet says that the 4.7-inch model is set to begin mass-production later this month, with the 5.5-inch ramping up in August.
* The bulk of the manufacturing will take place at Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, also known as Foxconn. Pegatron is also said to be taking orders for the upcoming handset, and both companies have gone on hiring sprees to handle the workload…
* Here’s more from the Reuters report:
* Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, the world’s largest contract manufacturer of electronic goods, will begin mass production of Apple Inc’s next-generation iPhone this month, local media reported Friday.
* Mass production of a 4.7-inch successor to the wildly popular iPhone 5 series of smartphones will begin during the third week of July, Taiwan’s Economic Daily News said, without citing sources. Production of a 5.5-inch version will begin during the second week of August, it said.
* That the outlet says production for the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 will start just a month behind the 4.7 contradicts recent reports, which claimed that issues could delay the larger handset into 2015. It’s possible, though, that Apple is just anticipating smaller demand.
* The iPhone 6 is widely expected to be introduced in mid-September, with a launch date shortly after that. In addition to the larger displays, the phone is said to feature a new slimmer design, faster A8 processor, improved camera, multiple new sensors, and more.
