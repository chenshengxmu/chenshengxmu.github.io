* It looks like the highly anticipated Family Guy project from Fox and TinyCo is set to be released next week. At a launch event in Los Angeles last night, the two firms announced that ‘Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff’ will be landing on iOS on April 10.
* First revealed in December of last year, the game will be set in the infamous town of Quahog and feature elements of resource management, with multiple story lines. It looks similar to Fox’s other hit TV series-turned-game: The Simpsons Tapped Out…
* Here’s more on the game from MacRumors:
* At a launch event in Los Angeles tonight, Fox and development house TinyCo officially revealed that its upcoming title Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff is set to launch a week from now. First revealed last month, the game is centered around the town of Quahog, with gamers helping Peter Griffin and the rest of the town’s residents rebuild their city after a destructive fight between Peter and Ernie The Giant Chicken.
* And here’s another screenshot of the game:

* The good news is, TinyCo is working closely with the creators of the show to ensure an authentic experience. The game will feature all the voice actors from the series, as well as new animations and new jokes from Seth MacFarlane’s Fuzzy Door Productions.
* Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff will launch a week from today, on April 10, and will be available for both the iPhone and iPad. We’re expecting it to be a free-to-play title, so don’t be surprised if the game is littered with seasonal content and in-app purchases.
