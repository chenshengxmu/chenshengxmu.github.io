* It has been a relatively slow couple of days in iPhone land, however it’s been brought to our attention that Apple is interested in some Terminator material. The newest SEC discovery states that the folks in Cupertino are in the market for some liquid metal. For what? Nobody is sure, however my imagination feels a morphable iDevice would do just fine.
* In all seriousness though, the report states Apple has come to terms with Liquidmetal Technologies, whose speciality is amorphous metals. The alloy materials the company produces could have benefits that are, but not limited to, hardness, elasticity and acoustical features.
* Not much more to report on this arrangement, but I will leave you with word for word filing. Just so you know, Arnold could not be reached for comment.
* On August 5, 2010, Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Liquidmetal”), entered into a Master Transaction Agreement with Apple Inc., a California corporation (“Apple”), pursuant to which (i) Liquidmetal contributed substantially all of its intellectual property assets to a newly organized special-purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary (the “IP Company”), (ii) the IP Company granted to Apple a perpetual, worldwide, fully-paid, exclusive license to commercialize such intellectual property in the field of consumer electronic products in exchange for a license fee, and (iii) the IP Company granted back to Liquidmetal a perpetual, worldwide, fully-paid, exclusive license to commercialize such intellectual property in all other fields of use (together with all ancillary agreements, the “Master Transaction Agreement”).
