* For this tutorial, we are going to explain how to set up your iOS device so that you can use a different signature for each email account. If you prefer to keep your personal life separate from your work life, you might find this little tip useful…
* I like reading signature lines. Some of my friends are pretty clever and will add funny quips. My family members usually offer some sage advice after their signature. Businesses always include additional contact information. Your signature line can be a subtle way of expressing yourself.
* If you have different email accounts, which most people do, you may want to have a different signature line for each. You can make this happen with just a few simple steps. These instructions work for the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.
* 1) Go to Settings > Mail > Signature.

* 2) In the Signature section, you’ll be able to select either All Accounts or Per Account. Tap Per Account. When you do, all email accounts linked to that device will show their respective current signature.
* 3) To change one, simply select the signature, delete it, and replace it with whatever you like.
* Once you have changed the signature line for each email, it will automatically show up when you send a new message.
* That’s it.
* Do you have any funny stories about sending emails to the wrong person or using inappropriate signature lines?
