* Carrier AT&T this morning announced an expansion of its fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (LTE) radio technology to three new markets. Beginning today, customers in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; Nashua, New Hampshire; and Grand Rapids, Michigan should start seeing greater download and upload speeds when using LTE-enabled smartphones, tablets and other devices on AT&T’s network.
* Although Consumer Reports ranks AT&T the worst of major US telcos in terms of customer satisfaction and voice/data service quality, it’s also the nation’s leading LTE carrier overall even though in terms of coverage AT&T trails Verizon, which claims the nation’s most robust 4G network…
* Among the LTE benefits AT&T is highlighting: faster speeds, faster response time, cool new devices and more efficient use of spectrum.
* Last week, the carrier flipped the switchon 4G LTE in Albuquerque, Reading, Salt Lake City and Puerto Rico. The company doubled its LTE coverage in 2012. In mid-November, AT&T’s LTE covered more than 150 million people in a total of 103 markets.
* The $14 billion LTE network expansion project has the carrier expanding LTE to 250 million people by year-end 2013 and to 300 million by year-end 2014.
