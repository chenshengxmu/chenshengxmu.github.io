* As most of you know already, Samsung unveiled its highly anticipated Galaxy S III successor last week, the S4. The handset will sell head-to-head against the iPhone 5 until Apple releases its next-gen smartphone, which is expected sometimes this summer.
* While the jury is still out on which handset provides the best user experience — easy-of-use, reliability, etc — the S4 is certainly looking better on paper. It has a sharper screen, a bigger battery, and according to new benchmarks, a much, much fast processor…
* Primate Labs, the firm behind the Geekbench ranking system, has analyzed Geekbench 2 scores for the Galaxy S4 (via MacRumors), comparing it to a number of other smartphones including the HTC One, LG Nexus 4, BlackBerry Z10 and yes, the iPhone 5.

* Notice that the processor in the tested Galaxy S4 is of the Snapdragon quad core variety. This is actually the less-powerful chip of the two that will be shipping with the handset, as some countries will be getting an S4 with Samsung’s 8-core Exynos processor.
* That being said, higher processor speed doesn’t always equal a better user experience or faster performance. Apple’s vertical integration of hardware and software, for example, allows it to squeeze more power out of its processors, with much greater efficiency.
* It’ll be interesting to see how the two handsets — the S4 and the iPhone 5 — compare to each other in real world use. But unfortunately, we probably won’t see those tests for a while. Samsung says the new Galaxy phone won’t start shipping until the end of April.
