* We previously heard October should be for new iPads. As various parts and components are now leaking out from China on a daily basis, it’s fairly safe to assume that next-generation iPads are indeed around the corner. Just recently, we’ve seen leaked iPad 5 schematics, shells and an alleged Touch ID module and now a set of photographs have been posted online seemingly depicting the rear case of both the iPad 5 and iPad mini 2.
* Provided these shots are legit, Apple could pull an iPhone 5s and provide both new iPads in gold, in addition to the previously leaked white and space grey finishes…
* The photos were first published by Chinese-language C Technology. Looks like our favorite 3D artist Martin Hajek nailed it by calling for the iPhone 5 and iPad mini 2 in gold.
* Check out a closeup of the fifth-generation iPad’s back shell.

* The side-by-side comparison top of post shows the iPad 5 and iPad mini 2 rear shells while the below shot indicates these parts were obtained from Apple’s supplier ZH. Australian parts leaker Sonny Dickson this weekend published a set of crisp high-resolution photographs of the iPad 5 rear shell – again, indicating the device will adopt the iPad mini’s thin design.

* It’s worth remembering that C Technology previously published the first video of a fully assembled and powered on iPhone 5c running the stock iOS 7 Safari browser, in addition to a few assembly line iPhone 5c shots and iPhone 5s packaging. After Apple formally announced the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, the publication’s leaks have proven to be genuine.
* Specs-wise, the rumor-mill thinks the iPad 5 and iPad mini 2 will pack in Apple’s Retina display, the eight-megapixel iSight camera, the A7X processor and Touch ID fingerprint scanning incorporated into the Home button.
* There has been some speculation about the second-generation iPad mini containing an A6X chip. However, as recent leaks have pointed to fingerprint scanning, the A7X processor is more likely because Touch ID requires Apple’s in-house designed 64-bit A7 chip with Secure Enclave.
* The Wall Street Journal-owned technology blog, AllThingsD, thinks the big day is due on October 22 (and The Loop‘s Jim Dalrymple concurs) and we’re of course expecting Apple invites to go out real soon.
* Who’s looking forward to updated iPads?
