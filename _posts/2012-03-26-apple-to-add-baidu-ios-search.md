* If Apple’s multiple mapping firm acquisitions and recent iPhoto makeover haven’t convinced you that the company is trying to distance itself from Google as much as possible, maybe this will.
* Sina Tech is reporting that it has learned that Apple is looking to add Baidu, China’s market-leading internet search company, as a default search engine option in iOS. So long Google…
* According to the report, the Baidu integration is expected to make its way to Chinese devices via a software update. And users could see the new firmware as early as next month.
* As TheNextWeb points out, the move is far from shocking. Baidu is responsible for a staggering 83.6% of internet searches in China, so making it a default search engine option in iOS makes sense. Also keep in mind that Apple has offered Bing and Yahoo as Google Search alternatives for quite some time now.
* Regardless of the reasoning behind it, this could spell serious trouble for Google’s mobile search business in China. It’s already trailing its competitor by 60%. And once Baidu is integrated into iOS — which sees more devices activated in China than in the US — it’s going to be even harder for Google to gain ground.
