* Of the running Wallpapers of the Week section, Star Wars wallpapers are among the most popular. Today’s collection features fan art in the noir and minimalist categories, taking a new spin on our previous Star Wars wallpaper posts.
* With a six year span of Star Wars movies, starting with The Force Awakens in 2015 and a new movie launching each year until 2020, Star Wars wallpapers will continue to be a popular category for new and old fans alike. Inside, take a look at the newest selection and download images for your iPhone or desktop.
* The Wallpapers of the Week post is curated on Sundays, utilizing images found around the Internet, submitted to us, or found via Twitter. If you would like to give us a tip or submit an image, catch up with me @jim_gresham.
* The first collection is from artist Marko Manev, who hosts similar images of other categories on his personal gallery page. If you find anything you fancy, he also sells his work through an online store. Keep up with his musings via Twitter @markomanev.
