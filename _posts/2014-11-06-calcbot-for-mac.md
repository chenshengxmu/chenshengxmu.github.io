* Developer Tapbots has made a name for itself with an excellent Twitter client for the Mac and iOS, Tweetbot. They have other apps in their portfolio, too, and on Thursday released a nicely done Mac edition of Calcbot, an intelligent calculator and unit converter that made its iOS debut in July of 2010.
* Despite a somewhat steep asking price, keep in mind that Calcbot combines a compelling calculator and a powerful unit converter into a single, beautifully designed experience.
* Calcbot is a $4.99 download from the Mac App Store.
* In terms of calculations, Calcbot provides both basic and advanced features like complex scientific calculations with constants like Pi, Atomic Mass and more. The app also supports more than 500 different unit conversions and lets you favorite any calculation so you can refer to it later.
* Now that Calcbot for Mac is out I can get back to devoting my full attention to the Tweetbot for Mac update. It will be worth the wait.

* Built-in iCloud sync ensures that your favorites, contents of the history tape and your own constants are synchronized to all your Macs, and soon to all of your iOS devices.
* And that Calcbot has an aesthetically pleasing appearance with stylish animations and sound effects doesn’t hurt either. All told, there are lots of tiny details to explore and appreciate in the Mac version of Calcbot.
