* Fans of Realmac Software’s Clear to-do app who’ve always wanted its gestural user interface in a calendar app need look no further than Peek Calendar for iPhone, $1.99 in the App Store. It’s the calendar humanized, as developer Square Mountains puts it.
* The premise behind Peek Calendar, as its name suggests, is the decluttering of your calendar entries by providing an effective at-a-glance overview of your day and some novel gestures allowing you to literally peek inside the events.
* One of may favorite interactions: the shading gesture which allows you to see some Peek’s life events. Check out Peek Calendar in a sweet promotional video included right after the break…
* Designed in San Francisco and crafted in Tallinn by Square Mountains, Peek Calendar delights with Clear-like gestures and its novel interactions. The app is neither minimalistic nor does it want to cram every conceivable piece of information into an insufficient space.
* Yes, it’s clean because only key highlights get shown.
* No, it’s not a case of form over function because every piece of information or a feature can be accessed in a fraction of a second, either by swiping or pinching.
* For example, adding a new event is a simple matter of tapping and holding on a desired day in your timeline view. And to view detailed event information like the length and the location of the event, just drag or swipe to the right.

* It syncs with your existing calendar data (as defined in iOS Settings) for storing and reading the events so any event that’s visible in the stock Calendar app should also appear in Peek.
* Moreover, the app has timezone and alarm support with sound and vibration feedback, there are two color themes, you can choose when your workweek starts (Monday or Sunday), browse the events in Today, Tomorrow and the rest of the week view and more.
* Translucency in a calendar app, who knew?

* The gestures are genius, check out Peek in a video below.
* So, how about that shading gesture?
* On the flip side, there are some annoying omissions.
* For starters, the UI needs labels because the buttons are all icons and not very self-explanatory. Event invites don’t come through and iTunes release notes mention support for iOS Reminders, but I couldn’t get them work.
* It won’t show any event that goes past midnight and into the next day and originally wouldn’t show multi-day events, though a quick update addressed that issue.
* According to iTunes release notes, an update “based on your feedback” is due in the next few days. Once all of the quirks are ironed out, Peek Calendar will be highly recommended.
* You can learn more about the app at the official website.
* Peek Calendar is $1.99 in the App Store.
* iOS 7 is required and the download is only 3.3MB!
