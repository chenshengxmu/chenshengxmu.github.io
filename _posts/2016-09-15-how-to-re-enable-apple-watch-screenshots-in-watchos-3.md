* Like most Apple devices, the Apple Watch has from the onset included the ability to take a screenshot by simultaneously pressing the Side button and the Digital Crown. In watchOS 3, this feature is disabled by default, for a good reason: the shortcut clashes with a new feature where you press both buttons to pause or resume a workout in progress. Thankfully, there’s now a new switch to toggle screenshot taking.
* 1) In the Watch app on your paired iPhone, go to My Watch → General and toggle the Enable Screenshots switch on or off.

* Like before, any screenshots taken on an Apple Watch are automatically saved in the Camera roll on its paired iPhone, inside the Screenshots album.
* As mentioned, watchOS 3 uses a new shortcut to pause or resume a workout which requires you to simultaneously press both the Digital Crown and the Side button. If you enable screenshots, every time you pause or resume a workout you’ll snap screenshot too.
* To prevent that from happening, watchOS 3 includes a new feature that can automatically pause your workout when you stop moving and resume when you start moving, saving you from manually pausing or resuming it.

* To enable this feature, slide to the ON position the Running Auto Pause button in My Watch → Workout in the companion Watch app on your iPhone with iOS 10.
* watchOS 3 is available as a free software update for the original Apple Watch, Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2.
