* Google’s native mapping application for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad was bumped to version 4.19 this morning, bringing out a few enhancements meant to improve your navigation and Street View experience.
* For starters, a few new voice controls are now available in navigation to mute, unmute or turn on alerts only. You can also move around Street View by swiping, and more.
* In terms of other changes in this release of Google Maps, the photo gallery has received some love, too, with the ability to see images in 360-degree panoramic views.
* And lastly, the application makes it easier to know if a place you frequent is busy or not with short summaries atop the usual “Popular times” graph.
* Google Maps requires an iPhone, iPod touch and iPad with iOS 7.0 or later and includes a native watchOS app for your Apple Watch with turn-by-turn directions on your wrist.
* Grab Google Maps free of charge on the App Store.
