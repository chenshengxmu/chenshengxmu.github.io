* The 4-inch iPhone. According to just about every major news publication — The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, etc. — it’s coming. But where does that leave the 600,000+ apps designed for a 3.5″ screen and their developers?
* Well the most popular theory for how Apple will go about making a 4-inch iPhone is to give it a resolution of 640×1158, and an aspect ratio of 9:5. So Overdrive Design decided to show us what that would do to current apps…

* Not only would this route make it easier for developers to update their apps, but it would also allow for them to display a considerable amount of more information on the screen — all without making the iPhone itself much bigger.
* A screen that’s just half an inch larger may not seem like a very big deal. But for folks who spend more time on their iPhone — browsing the web, reading iBooks and emails — than they do on their computer or iPad, it could make a world of difference. Not to mention that a larger display would call for some kind of hardware redesign, something iPhone users have been clamoring for since last fall.
* If you like the above mockups, Overdrive Design has several more high-quality renderings showcasing different apps.
