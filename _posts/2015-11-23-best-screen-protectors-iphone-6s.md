* Not everyone is on board with the tempered glass trend. If you are a traditionalist, or just don’t think tempered class screen covers are worth the money, TechMatte’s AmFilm screen protector is a super low-cost protector. It has four protective layers, acrylic, scratch resistant hard coating, optical laminate, and a silicone adhesive, which makes it easier to remove without leaving behind any residue. It comes with an installation kit, which is a series of rubber bands and special tabs. The package includes three screen protectors for only $6. There is also a version for the iPhone 6s Plus for the same price.

* Easily the most interesting screen protector on our list is this smart version, which adds navigation buttons on your iPhone 6s’ bezel. The navigation buttons, which sit at the bottom of your device, are connected with a thin, invisible wire to a circuit at the top of your screen. So, you can hit the back button, write a tweet, and other actions that you would normally have to reach up to the top button for. It costs $10. There is a version for the iPhone 6s Plus for $11.
