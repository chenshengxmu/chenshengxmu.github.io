* Following developer-only iOS 11.4 and tvOS 11.4 betas, members of Apple’s Beta Software Program can now install the forthcoming software updates on their iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.
* We don’t condone installing beta software on your daily drivers.
* To install the betas, first sign in with your Apple ID at beta.apple.com and accept Apple’s terms. Now, visit beta.apple.com/profile in Safari on your iOS device to grab and install the official configuration profile that allows your device to receive public beta updates over the air.
* To install the iOS 11.4 public beta, go to Settings → General → Software Update.
* Both iOS 11.4 and tvOS 11.4 bring back two missing features announced at WWDC 2017, AirPlay 2 and Messages in iCloud. AirPlay 2, shown in our video embedded below, brings multi-room audio and the ability for your Apple TV to automatically appear in the Home app.

* With AirPlay 2, you can also combine and control multiple audio sources at once through Control Center, desktop iTunes or via AirPlay controls on Apple TV. Lastly, AirPlay 2 will power HomePod stereo pairing when a matching HomePod beta software arrives.
* Other changes in iOS 11.4 include support for Apple’s new ClassKit framework for building enhanced apps for education, the usual bug fixes and security patches and Messages in iCloud, a new feature that keeps the Messages database in iCloud so your device can load chats on demand while making backups smaller and faster.

* The tvOS 11.4 public beta also brings support for AirPlay 2 and bug fixes.
* The AirPlay 2 and Messages in iCloud features were supposed to be an integral part of last fall’s iOS 11.0 release. They slipped, however, resurfacing in the early iOS 11.3 beta only to be removed from subsequent betas without explanation.
