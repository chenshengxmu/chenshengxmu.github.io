* Apple’s online store has gone offline around the world ahead of today’s scheduled “Gather round” media event where the Cupertino tech giant is expected to unveil the latest iPhone Xs family, the new Apple Watch Series 4 and other new products.
* Attempting to visit store.apple.com at post time yielded a message: “Be right back. We’re making updates to the Apple Store. Check back soon.”
* The online store should go back up right after today’s keynote presentation, which will be held at the Steve Jobs Theater on the Apple Park campus, has wrapped up.
* TUTORIAL: How to watch Apple’s “Gather round” event live
* For the first time, the Apple Online Store message is accompanied by a nicely animated Apple logo showing a colorful outline running around the edges of the logo, as shown below.
* The press conference is scheduled to kick off at 10am PDT / 1pm EST.
* In addition to the OLED-based 5.8-inch iPhone Xs and the massive 6.4-inch iPhone Xs Max, and a new LCD-based 6.1-inch phone, our expectations for this event include Apple Watch Series 4, the elusive AirPower multi-device Qi wireless charger, maybe new AirPods and other perks.
