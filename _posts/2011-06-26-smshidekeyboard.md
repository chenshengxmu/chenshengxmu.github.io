* One of the new features in iOS 5 is the ability to hide your keyboard when viewing your SMS history in the iMessage app.
* It didn’t take long, but there is now a jailbreak tweak available that mimics said functionality, and even allows you to hide the input box as well.
* For longtime biteSMS users, this won’t be new to you, but if you’ve been hanging onto that old outdated Messages app, this is a must have tweak to add to your collection.
* Check inside for the video details surrounding SMSHideKeyboard…
* As you can see, not only are you able to hide the keyboard, but you’re able to enter a pseudo-full screen mode as well.
* I don’t see how you’ve been clenching onto the iPhone’s terrible stock messaging app for so long, but if so, you’re going to want to go ahead and grab SMSHideKeyboard.
* You’ll need to add Ryan Petrich’s repo in order to find it. His repo address is as follows: http://rpetri.ch/repo
* If you have a jailbroken iPhone and you’ve given SMSHideKeyboard a whirl, let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
