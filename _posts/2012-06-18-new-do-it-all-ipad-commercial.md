* Apple has started airing a new iPad commercial this evening entitled “Do It All.” As the name suggests, the ad gives examples of some of the many things you can do with the tablet.
* The spot covers everything from sending an email to creating a presentation. And the commercial ends with the tagline “Do it all more beautifully, with the Retina display on iPad…”
* Perhaps more interesting than the ad itself, is the timing of its release. It appears that Apple intentionally set up the commercial to run just hours after Microsoft’s big tablet announcement.
* But Apple doesn’t have much to worry about — at least for now. Despite unveiling the Surface today, Microsoft has yet to name the tablet’s price, or even a proper release date.
* Nevertheless, what did you think of the new TV spot?
