* On Thursday, Sept. 13, Apple Music is hosting a special performance in Paris for Christine and the Queen’s. Called “Apple Music Presents: Chris,” the concert will be recorded and then streamed on the service beginning on Friday, Sept. 14. One week later, the band’s new album, “Chris,” will officially launch. (via iGeneration)
* Held at the Salle Pleyel concert hall, the event begins at 7 p.m. local time. As Apple explains:
* Join Christine and the Queens and Apple Music for a special performance of new music from the forthcoming album Chris, and an exclusive screening of the Apple Music film of the same name – which is a look into the titular character that inspired it all.
* Chris is an intimate peek into the intrepid French singer-songwriter-producer’s creative process while she writes and records her forthcoming album, a daring exploration of self and sexuality, identity and perception.
* Since Apple ended its annual iTunes Music Festivals after 2016, the company has concentrated on holding both special performances and exclusive documentaries on its Apple Music platform. In May, for example, it hosted an event for Shawn Mendes. More recently, it launched short films about Kesha’s “Rainbow” and Ed Sheeran’s “Divide.”
* You can apply for tickets to “Apple Music Presents: Chris” in English or French.
