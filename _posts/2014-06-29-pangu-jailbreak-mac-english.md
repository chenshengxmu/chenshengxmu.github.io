* Users who weren’t able to jailbreak their iOS 7.1.x devices because of the lack of Mac support for the Pangu jailbreak tool can rejoice. Earlier today, the Pangu Team released Pangu 1.1.0 with a few improvements and bug fixes. Most notably, Pangu 1.1.0 brings support for Mac and is now available in English.
* Among the imrprovements, it appears that one major bug that threw some devices into a boot loop has been fixed. From what we hear, it is now much more stable than the previous version…
* The following changelog can be found on the English version of the team’s website:
* 1. Add English support.
* 2. Optimize the file size.
* 3. Fix the boot loop bug.
* 4. Use new info leak(infoleak?) vulnerability which discovered by ourself instead of the old one discovered by @i0n1c.
* 5. Add online self verification
* According to the Pangu Team, 25PP (PPsync) has been removed from the English version, leaving Cydia as the one and only installer. It is our understanding that the Chinese version still contains it though.
* We do not bundle any other application in english version except Cydia. Still don't forget to backup your data before using Pangu.

* If you successfully jailbroke your iOS 7.1.x device before using Pangu, then there is no reason for you to do anything at this time. If however you’ve been having issues, it might be a smart thing to do to restore and try again with Pangu 1.1.0.
* You can download Pangu 1.1.0 from here.
* For instructions on how to use Pangu, you can refer to our Pangu jailbreak tutorial for Mac and our Pangu jailbreak guide for Windows.
* If you decide to use Pangu 1.1.0, please let us know how it went for you.
