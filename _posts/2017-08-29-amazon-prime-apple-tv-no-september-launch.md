* Amazon’s upcoming Prime Video streaming app for the fourth-generation Apple TV was announced at WWDC as coming later this year, but it’s now looking increasingly unlikely that the software will be ready in time for Apple’s expected September 12 media event.
* According to a side-note in Recode’s report on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter, the app may not be live in time for Apple’s big reveal next month.
* Apple CEO Tim Cook announced at WWDC 2017 this June that Amazon’s Prime Video streaming service would be coming to the Apple TV set-top box “later this summer.”
* The highly request app—Prime Video is the sole major streaming video service that’s still absent from Apple TV—is believed to be result of a deal that Apple and Amazon have reached.
* BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowksi reported back in May that Amazon, as part of that revenue sharing deal, would at some point resume Apple TV sales through its web store.
