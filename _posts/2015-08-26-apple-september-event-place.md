* Apple has rented out the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco for its all-but-confirmed September iPhone event, reports Hoodline. The publication says it has seen documentation from event logistics indicating the company has the building through September 12th.
* Today’s news follows speculation from earlier this week that Apple is behind a mysterious “trade show” booking at the Civic Auditorium for the first two weeks in September. On Monday, SFPD officers and private security guards began patrolling the grounds at the building.
* If true, the venue certainly sets the stage for a major event. The Civic Auditorium holds up to 7,000 people—nearly 3 times that of the Flint Center used for last year’s iPhone 6 event—and according to Hoodline, authorities are preparing to shut down several streets in the area.
* Furthermore, planned street closures in the area reveal that Grove Street in front of the auditorium will be shut down to traffic from 6pm on Tuesday Sept. 8th to 11:59pm on Thursday Sept. 10th, while Fulton between Hyde and Larkin will be shut down on Wednesday Sept. 9th between 4am and 11:59pm.
* BuzzFeed’s well-connected John Paczkowski reported earlier this month that Apple is planning an event for Wednesday, September 9. The company is expected to use the stage to present a new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, as well as a redesigned Apple TV and possibly new iPads.
