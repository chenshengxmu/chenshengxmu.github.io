* And the pissing contest between Samsung and Apple continues. This time, the Korean electronics giant filed requests for preliminary injunction in France and Italy, citing two patent infringements related to wireless telecommunications technology, specifically Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) standards for 3G mobile handsets.
* The goal of this legal operation? Blocking the iPhone 4S sales in those two countries…
* “The infringed technology is essential to the reliable functioning of telecom networks and devices and Samsung believes that Apple’s violation as being too severe and that the iPhone 4S should be barred from sales.
* Apple has continued to flagrantly violate our intellectual property rights and free ride on our technology. We believe it is now necessary to take legal action to protect our innovation.”
* Samsung notes that it plans to file similar injunctions in other countries.
* Comments?
