* Folks who use eBay’s PayPal payment service will be happy to hear that the company updated its iOS client this morning, bringing the app to version 5.4. The update brings about an important new security feature as well as various other improvements.
* The new security feature allows you to attach your mobile phone to your PayPal account so that they can be sure it’s you authorizing activity. It does this by linking the phone number(s) of the device(s) you use PayPal on to your 4-digit security PIN code…
* Here’s the full change log for version 5.4:
* Check out our new features, security upgrades. Bigger! Better! More!
* • Boost your security. Link your phone so we can make absolutely sure it belongs to you • PayPal Extras MasterCard®, eBay MasterCard®, and PayPal Smart Connect customers! Now you can see your available credit in your Wallet and use it as your preferred way to pay in stores • We made some key accessibility updates for smoother in-store payments
* We’re always listening, so please send comments, suggestions, and words of encouragement to mobile-apps@paypal.com.
* This may not seem like a major update, but these days any kind of improvements involving security are notable. Just think about the hacks we hear about on a seemingly weekly basis—imagine if a service like PayPal were to fall victim to a large-scale attack.
* Adding to this, our interest in eBay’s payment platform skyrocketed last month when it was reported that it was in talks with Apple regarding its rumored mobile payment service. It was said that the company offered to do anything to be apart of the project.
* Anyway, if you’re a user I recommend grabbing this update as soon as possible and linking it to your phone. Extras, eBay MasterCard and Smart Connect customers will also want to update. As usual, you can find the latest version of PayPal in the App Store for free.
