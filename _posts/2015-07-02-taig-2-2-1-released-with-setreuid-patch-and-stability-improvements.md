* After a false start earlier this morning with an update to its iOS 8.4 jailbreak tool, TaiG has officially released version 2.2.1.
* This update is security oriented, as it contains the setreuid patch to prevent applications from obtaining to root privileges through setreuid. The update also contains stability improvements. If you’ve yet to jailbreak your iOS 8.4 device, it is recommended that you use this latest version of TaiG’s tool, version 2.2.1. 
* To download TaiG 2.2.1, head over to our downloads page.
* Here is the official change log for version 2.2.1:
* Indeed, it’s a brief update, but definitely necessary given the security concerns. Like previous TaiG releases, this one is still Windows-only, but you can use a virtual machine to easily jailbreak your iOS 8.4 device on a Mac via a virtual machine setup.
* Also, if you’re already jailbroken, then you can expect an update to the TaiG Untether package to touch down any minute now on Cydia. Once it does, simply update, and your device will receive the latest fixes as well.
* What if you updated to the original version of 2.2.1 and your device is now crashing? TaiG says wait for an update to Cydown to fix the issue:
* Very few TaiG V2.2.1 users have Cydia crashing, because Cydown changes Cydia’s file permission. If this happens,pls wait for Cydown update
