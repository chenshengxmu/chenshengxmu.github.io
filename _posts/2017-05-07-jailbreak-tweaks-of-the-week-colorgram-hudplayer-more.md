* The jailbreak community has been pretty unpredictable lately; just as you begin to think Cydia is going through a lull, developers surprise you with a bevy of fun and useful new releases.
* In this piece, we’ll discuss all of the jailbreak tweaks that were released throughout the week, starting with our favorites. We’ll outline the rest of them afterwards.

* ColorGram is a pretty cool jailbreak tweak for those of you that use the Instagram app, as it lets you configure custom color schemes for the app’s UI.
* You can customize the color of the background, the color of the tab buttons, and several other elements in the app to get rid of the bland black and white interface.
* Although there is a bit of work involved in colorizing each and every individual feature, the end result could be worth it, as it can look more visually appealing.

* HUDPlayer – FREE

* HUDPlayer is a tweak that replaces the ugly volume HUD in iOS with a banner notification-style interface with better aesthetics and additional information.
* In addition to showing the volume level, it will also display metadata about the Now Playing media, as well as album artwork.
* More importantly, HUDPlayer’s banner notification-style volume HUD is significantly less intrusive than stock, as it doesn’t pop up in the center of the screen and get in the way of everything you’re trying to look at. That said, it’s great for watching videos.
