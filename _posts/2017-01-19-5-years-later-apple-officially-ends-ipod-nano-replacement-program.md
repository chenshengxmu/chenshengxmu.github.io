* The first-generation iPod nano replacement program, which launched five years ago due to a potential fire risk from overheating, is no longer found on Apple’s Exchange and Repair Extension Programs webpage. Although the company appears to have now formally ended the program, it’s still honoring replacement requests as first discovered by MacRumors.
* Apple originally replaced iPod nanos with same-generation models, but later reports confirmed that some customers did receive current-generation models in exchange for their faulty first-generation units.
* After contact several Apple Authorized Service Providers, MacRumors was able to confirm that the program has indeed ended. “Apple’s support team initially informed us the program is no longer in place, but a senior AppleCare advisor honored the program after we escalated our request,” wrote the publication.

* Apple originally said that “in very rare cases” the battery inside the first-generation iPod nano might overheat and pose a safety risk. The affected iPod nanos were sold between September 2005 and December 2006.
* “This issue has been traced to a single battery supplier that produced batteries with a manufacturing defect,” reads Apple’s message sent to iPod nano owners back in 2011.
* Because the likelihood of an incident increases as the battery ages, the company asked first-generation iPod nano owners to stop using their music player and request a free replacement unit.
