* For the most part, the new iPad’s camera setup uses the same lens system as the iPhone 4S, and is capable of shooting videos in full 1080p. How does it stack up against the iPad 2’s video camera? Keep reading to find out…
* Even though our head-to-head test isn’t exactly scientific, you can tell a difference between the quality of the two clips. The new iPad’s video seems to be a tad sharper than its predecessor, and colors seem to be a bit more accurate.
* If you haven’t figured it out yet, we’ve managed to score some new iPads a good 8 hours before they officially go on sale. So make sure you stay tuned to iDB for more hands-on videos and head-to-head tests with other tablets.
