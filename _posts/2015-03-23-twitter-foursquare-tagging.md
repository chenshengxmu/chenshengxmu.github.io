* You will be soon able to tag specific locations in tweets thanks to an expanded Foursquare integration, the micro-blogging platform announced in a tweet Monday.
* “We’re working with Foursquare so you can tag specific locations in tweets,” reads the message. The new features is “coming soon,” added the firm.
* Currently, users can add additional location context to their tweeting by adding a general location label, such as “SoMa, San Francisco,” to their tweets using Twitter for Android, Twitter for iOS, twitter.com or other mobile apps.
* Soon, users will be able to label their tweets with very specific locations, businesses, landmarks or other points of interest provided by Foursquare.
* Such tweets will also include the coordinates of the location label you select. Here’s a video of how it’ll work in iOS.

* Again, the current implementation leaves a lot to be desired.
* While your tweets include geographical coordinates of the location you are tweeting from, locations you tag are just labels, which doesn’t make them very useful.
* This is what using location in tweets currently looks like.

* The upcoming, deeper Foursquare integration would change that, turning those labels into Foursquare-powered geographical coordinates as well.
* Tweeting with your location is disabled by default for everyone.
* Twitter’s support doc has more on using location in tweets.
* Twitter is available free in the App Store.
