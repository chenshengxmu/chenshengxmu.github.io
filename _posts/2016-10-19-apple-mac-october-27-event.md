* It’s official! Apple is holding an event on Thursday, October 27 on its Cupertino campus. On Wednesday afternoon the company sent out the above invitation to select members of the media, asking them to “join us for a special event.”
* We’ve been expecting an October Apple event for several weeks now, and yesterday a Recode report accurately predicted it would happen on the 27. And as the invite indicates, the focus of the event is believed to be new Mac hardware.

* But just what that new hardware could be is anyone’s guess. The redesigned MacBook Pro, with OLED touch bar and Touch ID, seems like safe bet, as does some sort of MacBook Air update. There has also been rumors of new hi-res displays.
* Apple will be live-streaming the event, which kicks off at 10 a.m. (PDT) on October 27. As usual, we will be covering the event live here on iDB, as well as all subsequent announcements throughout the day.
