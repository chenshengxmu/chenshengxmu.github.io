* Apple today previewed all-new battery and CPU throttling features and other enhancements coming to iPhone, iPad and iPod touch this spring with iOS 11.3. Registered developers and members of the paid Apple Developer Program can now install the iOS 11.3 beta and test-drive the new features.
* The iOS 11.3 developer beta has a build number of 15E5167f.
* Unfortunately, the two most eagerly anticipated features—battery health and the new power management capability that dynamically manages maximum CPU performance to prevent unexpected shutdowns—are not available in this beta and will be coming in a later iOS 11.3 beta release.
* To install the beta, install an appropriate Apple configuration profile for your iOS device from the company’s portal for developers, then restart the device and go to Settings → General → Software Update to install the iOS 11.3 beta over the air.
* iOS 11.3 will bring the following new features:
* As mentioned, this is a developer-focused preview of iOS 11.3. If you’re not a member of Apple’s iOS Developer Program, you won’t be able to install the beat on your device. Apple also cautions that ”not all features will be in the beta releases.”
* The general public will get a chance to test-drive the new iOS 11.3 features when a public beta preview is made available at beta.apple.com. We expect the iOS 11.3 public beta to arrive later this week. Apple usually releases public betas 24-48 hours following their developer release.
* iOS 11.3 will release sometime this spring as a free software update for iPhone 5s and later, all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, the fifth-generation iPad, iPad mini 2 and later and the sixth-generation iPod touch.
