* Specialized publication AdAge is out with a new report which asserts – based on chit-chats with the obligatory “people familiar with the matter” – that Apple and the Vevo music website (no, I’m not capitalizing the name) have teamed up on providing the official app for the Apple TV to stream music videos 24/7 over the Internet. Akin to the Vevo TV feature found in Vevo’s existing iPhone and iPad programs, the Apple TV application would offer non-stop streaming of music videos from Vevo’s content partners.
* Such a piece of software has the potential to effectively turn your $99 set-top box into the MTV jukebox for the 21st century. Keep in mind Vevo controls a catalog of 75,000 music videos from more than 21,000 artists…
* AdAge has the story:
* Cord-cutting millennials will soon have a new way to quench their insatiable thirst for ’90s nostalgia. Music video website Vevo is developing an app for Apple TV that will offer up its 24-7 music video channel, according to people familiar with the matter.
* The publication is likely referring to Vevo TV, the company’s 24/7 linear music video streaming ala MTV which launched in March 2013.
* Vevo TV is currently available on iOS, Android and Windows devices, in addition to Roku, BlackBerry’s PlayBook tablet and Xbox Live.
* Adidas, McDonald’s, Red Bull and State Farm are all currently running ads on Vevo TV. The Apple TV app will allow the startup “to sell ads made specifically for televisions,” AdAge reports.
* The Vevo service was established in December 2009 as a joint venture music video website operated by Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, Google and Abu Dhabi Media.
* Music videos on Vevo are syndicated across the web, with Google and Vevo sharing the advertising revenue and Google’s YouTube hosting Vevo channels.
* Just two months ago, Apple brought us the HBO Go and WatchESPN live video streaming apps for cable subscribers who own an Apple TV.
* Go ahead and download the free Vevo and Vevo HD apps from the App Store to check out why all the fuss about Vevo TV.
* I can tell you Vevo is my favorite thingie when hosting parties: I just hook up my iPad to a 50-inch plasma TV, fire up Vevo TV and let those music videos roll all night long.
