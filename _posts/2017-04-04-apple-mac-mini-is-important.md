* Mac mini is an “important” model in Apple’s family of computers and will remain a product in the company’s lineup for the time being, said Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller when BuzzFeed’s reporter John Paczkowski asked him about the state of the most affordable Mac desktop. He did not say, however, when the small computer might receive a hardware refresh.
* Apple says that Mac mini is a mix of consumer with some pro use.
* According to Schiller:
* I’ll say the Mac Mini is an important product in our lineup and we weren’t bringing it up because it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use. Mac Mini remains a product in our lineup, but nothing more to say about it today.
* Originally released on January 22, 2005, Mac mini was last updated more than two years ago in October 2014 with Intel’s Haswell CPU platform, improved graphics, $100 lower price for the base model and more. Unfortunately, the current Mac minis do not have user upgradable RAM because the memory chips are now soldered to the logic board.
* Do you own a Mac mini?
* I used a previous-generation model for years, mainly as a home theater device sitting under my telly and running Plex, macOS Server, iTunes and other services. With the advent of the fourth-generation Apple TV, I figured that tvOS and apps like Infuse make for the ultimate home theater solution so I sold my Mac mini.
