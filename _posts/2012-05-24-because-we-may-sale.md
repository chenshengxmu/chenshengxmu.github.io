* I’ve always been as much of a sucker for not-to-be-missed deals on App Store games as the other guy. And why wouldn’t anyone want great value for their hard-earned cash?
* If you’ve been on the lookout for deep discounts on dozens of notable games for your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, you don’t wanna miss out on this insane deal.
* Organized by a bunch of independent developers who banded together for greater cause, it spans application stores across multiple platforms…
* Aptly named Because We May, this one’s in celebration of application marketplaces which allow developers to set their own prices.
* Discounted games include items found on Apple’s App Store and Mac App Store, Google’s Play store for Android, Microsoft’s Windows Marketplace, as well as the Steam platform and direct distribution channels.
* According to the official website:
* We believe that developers should have the freedom to price their games how they like, without interference from the online stores that sell the games. Why? Because it allows us to promote our games more freely, as we are doing here! We rely on the ability to promote our games for our livelihood and control over pricing is an important tool for this purpose.
* Here’s the official trailer.
* The weeklong promotion runs from May 24 through June 1.
* At post time, there were more than 150 inexpensive iOS games on offer and about 50 discounted games for the Mac.
* I urge you to take a look because discounts are pretty substantial.
* I found some awesome games I’ve been looking to buy for some time.
* Some notables include Spider: The Secret of Bryce Manor for the iPhone or iPad now costing 99 cents each (down from three bucks each) and Superbrothers’ Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP Micro for the iPhone costing 99 cents (down from $3) and Sword & Sworcery EP universal slashed to three bucks a pop (down from $5).
* Has something already piqued your interest?
