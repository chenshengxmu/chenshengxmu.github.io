* Sony’s biopic of late Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs is shaping up to be quite a film — much better than the indie flick that Ashton Kutcher is starring in.
* Not only does the studio own the rights to Jobs’ widely-popular biography, but Variety is reporting that it has just tapped Aaron Sorkin to write the script for the movie…
* If the name sounds familiar, it’s because Sorkin is the brilliant mind behind Sony’s Academy Award-winning film, The Social Network. The story, based on the early days of Facebook, won Sorkin ‘Best Adapted Screenplay.’
* Here’s what Sony had to say about the announcement:
* “Steve Jobs’ story is unique: He was one of the most revolutionary and influential men not just of our time, but of all time. There is no writer working in Hollywood today who is more capable of capturing such an extraordinary life for the screen than Aaron Sorkin; in his hands, we’re confident that the film will be everything that Jobs himself was: captivating, entertaining, and polarizing.”
* Now all Sony has to do is get itself a good production crew, and it’ll be set. Oh yeah, and pick a star to play Steve Jobs.
* Any suggestions?
