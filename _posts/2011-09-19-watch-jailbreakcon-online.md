* JailbreakCon, formerly known as MyGreatFest, was the world’s first jailbreak convention held in London this past weekend. Speakers like saurik and members of the Chronic Dev Team spoke on the state of jailbreaking, and other prominent developers from the community shared insights into different aspects of the jailbreak world.
* We gave you coverage of what you missed at the last JailbreakCon, but many of you have wanted to watch videos of the presentations. Good news: the video of the entire event has been posted online…
* To learn more about JailbreakCon, visit the convention’s website. Also, stay tuned to iDB to learn more about JailbreakCon’s USA event next year.
