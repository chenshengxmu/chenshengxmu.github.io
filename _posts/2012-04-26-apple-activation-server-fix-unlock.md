* iPhone Dev Team member, MuscleNerd, just tweeted that Apple is currently working on fixing their activation servers.
* This means that sooner or later the SAM unlock will no longer work for your jailbroken iPhone.
* The good news is that if you backed up your activation ticket like we instructed in our tutorial, your current unlock should be safe for good.
* Looks like Apple’s currently fixing their activation servers. But the good news is that previous tickets gotten via SAM trick still work.

* MuscleNerd goes on to state that any new unlock requests will probably be “hit or miss” going forward, eventually to the point where they will be all “miss”.
* In other words, If you’ve yet to unlock and you still desire to, you better do so now.
* Not surprising at all to see Apple jump on this, I’m surprised they didn’t get to it sooner.
* What do you think? Have you unlocked yet?
* Update: And as expected, it looks like Apple has fixed the issue, and the SAM unlock is no longer a reality.
