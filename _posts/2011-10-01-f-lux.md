* It’s been a long time coming, but one of my favorite OS X utilities has made its way to iOS. Indeed, f.lux just appeared on the iPhone, but not via the conventional App Store method.
* f.lux is a handy utility that automatically adjusts the color temperature of your screen, resulting in significantly reduced eye-strain.
* Unfortunately, due to the nature of f.lux, it pretty much has no chance of ever appearing on the official App Store. Thankfully, the team behind this excellent tweak has found refuge on Cydia…
* Upon installation, you’ll find four lighting settings that you can adjust according to your environment. Once it gets past a certain hour, the iPhone will progressively adjust the color temperature of your display to make it more comfortable in the reduced light.
* Not only that, but the team also says that the color temperature has a direct bearing on a person’s quality of sleep after using a display. The more appropriate the temperature according to the time of day, the easier it will be to adjust when hitting the hay.
* If you haven’t already tried f.lux on the Mac, I highly encourage you to give it a shot. It’ll rock your world. I’m still adjusting to the iPhone version, but I have a feeling I’m going to dig it just as much as I do its big brother.
* Best of all, f.lux is free on both platforms. So, what are you waiting for? If your iPhone is jailbroken, head over to Cydia, check it out, and report back on how you liked it.
