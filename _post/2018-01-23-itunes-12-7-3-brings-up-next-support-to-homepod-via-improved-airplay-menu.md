* HomePod is arriving in less than three weeks and Apple is releasing advance software support for the $349 Siri-powered speaker ahead of its scheduled launch on Friday, February 9.
* iTunes 12.7.3 for Mac and Windows is now available with support for HomePod.
* To update iTunes to the latest available version, click the Updates tab within Mac App Store or choose Check for Updates from the iTunes menu.
* “iTunes is now designed to work with HomePod,” says the official changelog.
* For HomePod owners, iTunes provides an improved AirPlay volume control menu letting them choose their HomePod and control what plays next with their Apple Music subscription.
* iOS 11.2.5, which released today with HomePod support and other new features and important security fixes, includes a redesigned AirPlay menu via Control Center’s Music widget. Pressing the audio icon with 3D Touch now shows all detected playback sources in separate tiles.
* This lets you play some music or other audio on another device like Apple TV or your AirPlay-enabled home theater and control it separately from your iPhone.
