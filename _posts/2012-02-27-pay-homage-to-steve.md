* Since Steve Jobs passed away last year, fans have been coming up with new ways to pay homage to the long-time CEO. Some folks have written tributes, and others turned out at Apple Stores to pay their respects.
* But a theme designer, who calls himself monkystyle, took a different approach. He created a mic replacement for Siri so that jailbroken users can both customize the digital assistant, and pay homage to Steve. Introducing Stevi…
* Stevi is a new Siri microphone theme for your iPhone 4S. It replaces the standard mic image with a detailed silhouette of Mr. Jobs, and comes in red, blue and purple. It even works with the pulsating Siri animation that moves up and down as you speak.
* Now the tweak has a couple of downsides. For one, it requires WinterBoard, which a lot of folks refuse to use. And two, it’s going to run you $1. But if neither of those things bother you, you can find Stevi in the ZodTTD repo in the Cydia Store.
* What do you think of Stevi?
