* In the past, we’ve taken a look at countless gimbals for your iPhone, but some readers have been on the lookout for something a bit… bigger. We’ve gone hands-on with the Zhiyun Crane V2 gimbal that can handle anything up to a 3.9 pound DSLR.
* The gimbal itself is crafted largely out of metal.
* It comes in a handy carrying case which makes transporting it slightly easier than tossing it in your bag. The fact is, it’s still a big device and not something that you’ll be able to just stick in a back pocket.
* But first, check out our hands-on video showcasing the gimbal and our sample footage.

* As another benefit, the gimbal comes apart into two pieces at the handle. This not only makes it slightly more compact, but is where the batteries are inserted as well.
* When you first set up your gimbal, it’s important to properly balance everything. There are quite a number of fine adjustments to account for but once you are setup, you should be good to go.

* For instance, if you have a bit of a larger lens and your camera is situated a bit too far forward, the camera will bounce a bit as you move the gimbal around.
* Once balanced, you’re ready to shoot some ultra smooth video.
* The front of the gimbal has several controls making it easy to get the shot you need. There is a mode button, a joystick, zoom control and your shutter button. There is one big limitation though.
* The zoom and shutter button will only work if you are using a supported camera, namely specific models from Panasonic and Sony.

* I look at this as more of a positive than a negative.
* If you don’t have those cameras, you can still use this accessory as a normal gimbal. If you do happen to have one, you gain additional functionality.
* Crane V2 is quite a hefty beast, large in size as well as in weight.
* While it’s something you can easily hold in your hand, the mount on the bottom lets you easily affix it to a tripod or mount. If you are planning a time-lapse, long exposure or something similar, this can make a big difference.

* As someone who shoots a ton of photos and videos, I’ve been immensely pleased with the performance out of Crane V2, both with my Nikon D500 and my more compact Sony a6000.
* This isn’t necessarily for everyone though. Previously, we took a look at the Smooth-II and Smooth-C—and found them to be excellent gimbals in their own right, designed for GoPros and smartphones.
* If you’re looking for something more portable, the aforementioned gimbals have similar build quality and performance to the Crane device.
* Now that even legendary filmmakers are shooting on iPhone, maybe these larger gimbals like Crane aren’t as needed as they used to be?

* The price of gimbals and stabilizers used to be astronomical.
* Crane V2 is one of a few pieces of gear capable of making professionally-looking buttery-smooth footage, and those capabilities are now readily available and easily accessible to nearly any aspiring filmmaker.
* You can find the Crane V2 3-axis stabilizer on Amazon for $399, which is kind of shockingly affordable.
* Let me know your thoughts, and if you pick one up, down in the comments!
