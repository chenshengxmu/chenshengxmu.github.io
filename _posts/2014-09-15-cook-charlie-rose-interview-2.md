* PBS has posted a new clip of Tim Cook’s interview with Charlie Rose to YouTube this evening. The two-part interview, of which the first half aired on Friday night and the second half airs tonight, covers a wide range of topics, including Steve Jobs, the Apple Watch and more.
* The latest clip sees Cook talking with Rose about user privacy, and how Apple approaches the hot button issue. Cook explains that Apple isn’t in the business of collecting user data, and it purposefully designs its services—email, iMessage, etc.—to collect as little of it as possible.
* Cook has had to face concerns over user privacy and security a number of times throughout his 3-year tenure as Apple’s CEO. Last summer, the company was named as a participant in the NSA’s backdoor ‘PRISM’ program, and then of course there was the recent iCloud debacle.
* And these concerns will only continue to grow as Apple branches out into other services. Last week, the iPad maker announced a new mobile payment service called Apple Pay, and a health-tracking device called Apple Watch, the latter of which is already drawing privacy questions.
* If you missed part one of the Charlie Rose-Tim Cook interview last Friday, it’s available for streaming in its entirety here.
