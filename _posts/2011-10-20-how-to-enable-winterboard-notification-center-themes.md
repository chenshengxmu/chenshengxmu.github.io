* So you downloaded that pretty Aluminum Notification Center theme mentioned in our iOS 5 WinterBoard video walkthrough, and it didn’t work; now what?
* Fortunately there’s a workaround for the Notification Center theme issue, as many people made me aware of after our video went live late last night.
* Inside, I’ll show you how to enable Notification Center themes on your iOS 5 device, using a handy workaround…
* Step 1: Follow our WinterBoard walkthrough to install a new Notification Center theme.
* Step 2: in iFile, SSH, etc, go to var/mobile/Library/Caches
* Step 3: Make a backup copy (optional) of ‘com.apple.SpringBoard.notifica­tionCenterLinen’ and delete the original.
* Step 4: Respring. If you don’t have SBSettings or other respring tool, you can respring via WinterBoard.
* Step 5: Open Notification Center, and you should see your new theme!
* Special thanks to everyone who sent this tip in to me. You are too numerous to name. It’s obvious that you guys are really passionate about your WinterBoard themes!
* By the way; what do you think about that iCloud-esque Aluminum theme? I think it’s pretty slick.
