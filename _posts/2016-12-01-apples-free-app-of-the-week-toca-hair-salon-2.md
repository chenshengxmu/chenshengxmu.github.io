* Like every Thursday, Apple today updated its Free App of the Week promotion on the App Store with a brand new item, a kids-friendly game called Toca Hair Salon 2. This means that for the next seven days, you’ll be able to download this app free of charge—a savings of $2.99.
* In Toca Hair Salon 2, you play as one of the six charming characters and run a hair salon of your own.
* There are lots of virtual tools of trade at your disposal which you’d find in any hair salon that let you cut, color and style any way you want, from a simple comb and scissors to a curling iron and a straightener.
* You’ll also trim other people’s mustaches, spray mohawks bright pink on their hair and do other creative things to give them the curls they’ve always wanted. Topping it all off, you can take advantage of a special hair-growing tonic to fix mistakes and style customers with hats, glasses and other fun accessories.
* Of course, characters make fun faces and sounds while you’re styling them.
* From App Store Editors’ notes:
* Nothing beats a kids-friendly game that keeps the whole family captivated—and Toca has us snipping, straightening and styling to our heart’s content. One we’ve perfected our customer’s silly new ‘dos, we make sure to add some accessories, snap a pic and share the hair.
* The game contains no third-party advertisements.
* Grab Toca Hair Salon 2 for free from the App Store until next Thursday.
