* Apple yesterday started dressing up the Yerba Buena Center building with banners for the next week’s iPhone 5 presser. If you believe Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster, the event will mark the biggest consumer electronics launch of the year as the analyst on multiple occasions likened the launch of Apple’s next iPhone to “the mother of all upgrades”.
* Adding up to the excitement, the global logistics services company FedEx issued a note to employees to brace themselves for a “surge volume” event during the period of September 21-24. The three-day period coincides with the expected launch weekend for the iPhone 5…
* The Memphis, Tennessee-headquartered company wrote the following in its note, obtained by MacRumors:
* Due to the upcoming ‘surge volume’ event beween Sep 21-24, this class has been postponed to the week of Nov 5-9 and you have automatically been moved to that class. If you are unable to attend the week of Nov 5-9, please send me an email and we’ll remove you from the roster.
* Thank you for your understanding.
* Apple said two days ago that the next iPhone is “almost here” and invited select members of the press to a media event due to take place on next Wednesday, September 12, at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts at 10:00 am.

* The handset should hit store shelves in the United States and a handful of major international markets the following Friday, September 21.
* There has been some concern that the iPhone 5 may first be offered exclusively by AT&T and Verizon, to be followed by Sprint and possibly other regional carriers later in October, but no solid evidence points to this being the case.
* iDB will be monitoring live blogs and web reports so you don’t have to, bringing you news as it happens.
* Are you tingling with expectation already?
