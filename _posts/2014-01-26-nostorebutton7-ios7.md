* In an effort to generate iTunes sales on iOS devices, Apple has long placed a Store button in the top menu bar of its Music app. As you would expect, tapping on Store exits the Music app and brings you to the iTunes Store for everything from songs and albums to movies and TV shows. It’s a convenient link from one app to another on iOS devices, but some users might not find use in it. If you’re one of those people, a new jailbreak tweak called NoStoreButton7 is a quick fix for you…
* You might remember NoStoreButton from past iOS versions, which inspired developer Riki Oktarianto to update the tweak with iOS 7 support. It’s one of the simplest jailbreak tweaks you’ll find on Cydia, as it removes the Store button only and has no further options to configure.
* Ultimately, if you find the Store button to be more of a nuisance than a convenience, the extension is available for free on Cydia in the BigBoss repository. The package is compatible with all iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices, including 64-bit models, running iOS 7 or later.
* On a side note, for those without jailbroken devices, there is also a stock method of disabling the Store button. Simply navigate to Settings > General > Restrictions and toggle off the iTunes Store. It’s important to note that this solution will completely disable access to the iTunes Store altogether, until you re-enter the restrictions passcode and reactivate the iTunes Store.
* If you are a fan of simple jailbreak tweaks like this one, be sure to take a look at BetterFolders, CamBlur7, ClassicDock, CyDelete7, DynamicText, StatusBarFix2 and many others we’ve covered recently. If there is a package that we haven’t covered yet here at iDownloadBlog, feel free to leave suggestions in the comments.
* Do you purchase music, movies or TV shows on the iTunes Store?
