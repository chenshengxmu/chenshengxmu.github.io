* Amazon today announced its long-rumored music streaming service to better compete with the likes of Apple Music, Spotify, Google Play Music, Tidal and others. The service is called Amazon Music Unlimited and starts at $9.99 per month for individual accounts or $14.99 per month for a family of six, which is the standard pricing offered by Apple Music and others.
* However, Amazon has undercut Apple Music with a $7.99 per month tier for members of its $99 per year Prime service. And if you want to only stream music to your Echo wireless speaker, Amazon Music Unlimited is just $3.99 per month.
* Amazon Music Unlimited gives you access to tens of millions of songs from all the major labels like Sony, Universal and Warner, as well as hundreds of independent labels.
* Like with other services, a free 30-day trial is available as well.

* The $14.99 per month family tier is coming soon. The service is available on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch via the redesigned Amazon Music app on the App Store.
* Amazon Music Unlimited offers offline listening, themed playlists curated by music experts, song and album recommendations personalized for you, a search feature and more. Echo owners can sign up for a low-priced $3.99 tier that limits streaming to their wireless speaker while offering integration with Amazon’s intelligent assistant Alexa to use voice commands to find and play music.
* In fact, Echo owners can easily sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited by asking Alexa to start their free trial. Amazon Music Unlimited is available starting today in the United States and will launch later this year in the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria.
* The new service shouldn’t be confused with Prime subscriptions that come with unlimited music streaming from a limited catalog of about a million songs in total.
