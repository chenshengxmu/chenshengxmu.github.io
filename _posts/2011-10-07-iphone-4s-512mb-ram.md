* When Apple announced the iPhone 4S on Tuesday, there was no mention of just how much RAM the new handset was packing. This didn’t seem too odd at the time, after all, Apple doesn’t usually for the Android approach of listing specifications in a hope to garner sales.
* What is interesting is the revelation from Chair Entertainment’s creative director Donald Mustard, who claims that the iPhone 4S only sports 512MB of RAM, not the presumed 1GB…
* Speaking to Eurogamer about the gaming prowess offered by the iPhone 4S’ new A5 architecture, Mustard let slip that the handset features 512MB of RAM, and not the expected 1GB:
* “I’m still shocked that, with the iPhone 4S, I’m literally running around with a 1080p video camera in my pocket, with an eight megapixel camera, 64GB of hard drive space and an A5 chip with 512MB of memory. This is a really powerful computer, right?”
* With Apple’s current iPhone 4 and iPad 2 models already host to 512MB of RAM, many pundits, including the entire iDB staff, wrongly assumed that the iPhone 4S would pack a little more punch. Throw in the fact that high-end Android phones also feature 1GB of RAM nowadays, and it was almost a dead certain that Apple would join in as well.
* Apple’s big iPhone 4S selling point is Siri, the company’s new digital assistant feature, which allows users to speak commands into the handset and have them acted upon. This new-old feature — it was originally an app on the iOS App Store before Apple bought the company out — is currently limited to Apple’s new iPhone 4S. Again, as we all thought the new handset packed more RAM, that made sense. Now, well, not so much.
* Is Apple simply holding Siri back from older handsets in an attempt to give the 4S a leg-up?
