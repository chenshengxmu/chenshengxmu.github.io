* For those of you who haven’t been keeping up with the latest jailbreak news, let me get you up to speed. Earlier this week, we learned that we could see the 5.1.1 untethered jailbreak drop as early as this week. We even saw a video of it in action.
* And now that pod2g, MuscleNerd, and several other iOS hackers are in Amsterdam at the Hack In The Box conference, expect to see news regarding the 5.1.1 jailbreak to ramp up. In fact, pod2g just gave as another quick update on his progress…
* “OK just added iPad3,3 support to Absinthe thanks to @flawlessfox. Only remains iPad2,4 now but we need the actual device.
* Any people of #HITB2012AMS has an iPad2,4? Model number: either MC954 or MC989. Please check in Settings / General / About”
* With only one device left to add to Absinthe 2.0, it looks like we could very well see the 5.1.1 jailbreak drop this week. There’s even talk that the Chronic Dev Team and company might release it Friday, during the Dream Team’s HITB keynote.
* For those of you planning on jailbreaking with the new utility, be sure to check out our guide on how to get your device ready. You may also want to check out how to donate money to the guys working on the new jailbreak.
