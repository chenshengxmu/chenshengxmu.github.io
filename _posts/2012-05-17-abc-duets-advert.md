* The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) has ripped off Apple’s famous advert dubbed 1984 in a cheapskate attempt to promote its upcoming new singing show called Duets (I know, don’t start).
* Alluding to George Orwell’s 1984 novel, ABC’s cheesy commercial blatantly copies Apple’s down to a lookalike of an unnamed heroine in white tank top that represented the coming of the Macintosh.
* Instead of throwing a large brass-headed hammer to smash a televised Big Brother, in ABC’s version an Olympic track and field athlete hurls a stage microphone at the big screen. Upon impact, the curtain falls down to reveal the familiar-looking set as the audience rises to a standing ovation…
* The show will air next Thursday, May 24. Judging by the advertisement, it probably won’t differ much from the likes of American Idol, X Factor and similarly dumb-named singing contests.
* Producers hired talents of Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Nettles, Lionel Richie and Robin Thicke who will travel across America to find their duet partners.
* Television personality Quddus, best known from his days as the host of MTV’s Total Request Live, will host the series.
* Duets?
* It’s a ‘meh’ in my book.
* Now that you’ve seen ABC’s commercial, compare it to Apple’s famous 1984 advert.
* Similarities, eh?
* As you know, 1984 aired only during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984 and just one other time on television.
* Why?
* Well, ironically enough the estate of George Orwell and the television rightsholder to the novel 1984 deemed it a flagrant copyright infringement. They were apparently enraged enough to send a cease-and-desist letter to Apple and its marketing agency Chiat/Day.
* As a result of legal pressure, the advert was never televised as a commercial after that, though it’s since been featured countless times on television commercial compilation specials.
* 27 years later, Motorola spoofed Apple with its own version of the 1984 advert. That one, too, premiered during Super Bowl.
* Interestingly enough, Apple’s recently uncovered four-minute sales footage also makes subtle references to the legendary 1984 advert.
* What did you think of the Duets advertisement?
* Would you call it a homage or a rip off?
