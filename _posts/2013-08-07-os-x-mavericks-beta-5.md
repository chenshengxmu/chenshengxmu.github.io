* Just 24 hours after seeding the fifth iOS 7 beta (here’s what’s new) to its registered iOS developers, Apple on Wednesday issued the fifth beta of the upcoming OS X Mavericks.
* The software is available for download to paid members of the Mac developer program through Apple’s Mac Dev Center or via Software Update in the Mac App Store.
* The new OS X Mavericks Developer Preview now for the first time includes iBooks for Mac, a brand new native Mac app Apple promised to include in the final Mavericks release come this Fall…
* As noted by MacRumors forum members, the fifth Developer Preview of Mavericks also includes a new iPhoto 9.4.6 beta (build 901.26). Just like iOS 7 Beta 5, major performance enhancements are readily apparent in OS X Mavericks Beta 5.
* Apple has also seeded an eighth version of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 Beta (build 12F33) to developers, along with Safari 6.1 Beta 5. That release contains no known issues, indicating that a Gold Master is just around the corner.

* Apple plans to offer OS X Mavericks for public consumption this (blockbuster) Fall.
* Though the operating system is focused on performance improvements and optimized battery consumption, it comes with a few headline new features such as Finder tabs and tags, improved  dual-monitor capabilities in full screen mode and a brand new Maps app that lets you easily beam directions to an iOS device.
