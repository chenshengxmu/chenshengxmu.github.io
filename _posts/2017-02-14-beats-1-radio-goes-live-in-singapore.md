* Apple’s global 24/7 Internet radio station, Beats 1 Radio, has gone live in Singapore on Tuesday. As first reported by Mashable, the online radio station has arrived to Singapore almost two years after Apple’s streaming music service first launched in the country. Beats 1 Radio debuted in 100+ countries. The online show does not require an Apple Music subscription to listen to and is being aired live from Los Angeles, New York and London, with an anchor DJ producing the show in each city.
* Beats 1 Radio’s delayed launch in Singapore is something of a mystery given the vast popularity of Apple’s products in the 5.4 million people country, with products like iPhone usually launched in Singapore on the same day as the US.
* Beats 1 Radio has been available in various markets across the region, such as Hong Kong, Thailand and the Philippines, since 2015. At present, the online radio station is unavailable in the Bahamas, Bahrain, Burkina-Faso, China, Egypt, Jordan, the Lebanon, Mozambique, Namibia, the UAE and Qatar.
* Apple’s support documents lists Apple Music, Beats 1 Radio and iTunes Match availability by country.
