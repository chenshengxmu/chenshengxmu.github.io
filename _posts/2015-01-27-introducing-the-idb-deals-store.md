* Everybody at iDB is happy to announce the iDB Deals Store. Developed in partnership with our friends at StackSocial, the iDB Deals Store will bring you exclusive deals on Apple and iOS gear, accessories, software, and more. And to mark the launch of the store, we’re offering 10% off everything in there for the next week!
* Besides the new Deals section, nothing will really change on the site. Each week, we will be highlighting some of the deals directly here on iDB, just like we’ve been doing for a while now. Don’t you worry though, we won’t turn iDB into a deals machine, and the last thing we want is to overwhelm you with a bunch of deals that are irrelevant to you. So no, you won’t find a deal here for a subscription to US Weekly, but do expect to see some deals on cool iPhone accessories, great Mac apps, developer courses, and the likes.
* To top it all off, we’re lining up some serious giveaways for all iDB readers, so stay tuned for that!
* The store can easily be accessed from this link, or simply from the Deals tab in the header of the site. Please make sure to check it out and leave your feedback below and on each deal post. Because this is all new to us, we’re very excited to see what you think and take your suggestions into account to make sure the experience is as positive as can be.
* As mentioned above, and to celebrate the event, we’re offering 10% off everything. Simply use coupon code IDBDEALS10 at checkout and your discount will be automatically applied. This coupon will expire on February 3rd, so hurry while it lasts!
* Once again, feel free to give us some feedback. What kind of products do you want to see in the store?  Should we specifically focus on iOS and Mac stuff? Please make sure to share your opinion below.
