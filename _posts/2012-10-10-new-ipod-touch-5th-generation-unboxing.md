title: We unbox the new 5th generation iPod touch
---
* Just about an hour ago I was able to get my hands on a brand new 32GB Slate Black 5th generation iPod touch. Here is our official unboxing video of Apple’s revamped mobile gaming everything device.
* The first thing you’ll notice about the new iPod touch is how thin it is when compared with the iPhone 5. If you thought Apple’s new iPhone was thin, wait until you get a load of the 5th generation iPod touch!
* The second thing you’ll notice is how drastically better the 5th generation is when compared to the previous generations. The new iPod touch is leaps and bounds above any previous touch when it comes to build quality. Even the screen looks amazing. What do you think? Oh, and uh, the Lightning cable is $19, not $29 like I mistakenly stated in the video.
