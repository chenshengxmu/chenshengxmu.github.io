* As expected, Google has started rolling out its popular Street View feature to the web version of its Maps app this morning, bringing the option back to iPhone 5 and iOS 6 users.
* Early reports claimed that the data was limited to the US and Canada. But now it appears that the feature has gone live around the world. Keep reading for our first impressions…

* Street View in and of itself is impressive. Navigation is surprisingly smooth, the picture quality is at least on par with its native counterpart, and we had no trouble finding places to test it out.
* It is worth pointing out, however, that there’s no zoom option here, which is kind of a bummer. And we have noticed a few bugs here and there, like image distortion and windows force closing.
* But overall, the feature looks and works great. And folks who have been missing it on iOS 6 will be happy to have it back. This should tide them over until a native Google Maps app hits.
* If one ever does.
* Anyway, what do you think of the mobile web version of Street View?
