title: iPhone 4 Unlock to Become a Priority for the Dev Team

* A couple weeks ago we reported that the Dev Team was working on a baseband downgrade method that would allow for an easier iPhone unlock. This baseband downgrade method was supposed to downgrade any iPhone baseband (including 06.15.00) to a baseband version that can easily be unlocked with UltraSn0w.
* Today, someone asked MuscleNerd on Twitter when this baseband downgrade would be out, and while the answer isn’t exactly what most of you would expect, MuscleNerd gave us an indication about the Dev Team’s priorities…
* According to MuscleNerd, the baseband downgrade method won’t be looked into until the Dev Team has figured out an unlock for the iPhone 4. That’s very good news for people like me who use an iPhone 4 as a primary device. Maybe not so good news for those of you who don’t want to upgrade the baseband to 06.15.00 or are stuck with issues at 06.15.00.
* Top priority right now for the Dev Team is to work on the untethered jailbreak for 4.2.1. Then they’ll most likley start working on the iPhone 4 with iOS 4.2.1 unlock. Finally, they will focus their efforts on a baseband downgrade method.
* Things can change really quickly in the jailbreak world. With the release of iOS 4.3 right around the corner, the Dev Team’s plans might have to change and adapt to the current situation once again.
* Are you excited about the iPhone 4 unlock? Or are you disappointed you’ll have to wait to downgrade your baseband?
