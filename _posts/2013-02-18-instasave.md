* Wouldn’t it be nice if you could save your favorite Instagram photos directly to your Camera roll? Well, that’s the exact premise behind a new jailbreak tweak called InstaSave. InstaSave is an extremely simple tweak, in fact there are no settings to configure after installation.
* Once installed, you’ll notice a new Save option appear after tapping the ellipsis button when viewing your favorite photos. Take a look inside for more details as to how InstaSave works.

* Before InstaSave is installed, and after InstaSave is installed
* As you can see, the new Save button appears neatly beneath the Report Inappropriate, Share to Facebook, and Tweet buttons. It looks as if the Save button is a stock feature that was there all along, and doesn’t stand out as awkward or obtuse.

* Once you tap save, the image appears in your Camera roll
* Once you save your favorite photos, a Save dialogue will briefly fade over the photo in question, and the photo will be whisked away to your local Camera roll. While it is true that you could just opt to take a screenshot of your screen and crop the photo, this method eliminates the need to crop any photos.
* InstaSave is a free jailbreak tweak available right now on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you’re a heavy Instagram user, then I suggest giving it a try. What do you think?
