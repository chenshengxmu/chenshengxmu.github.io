* Almost a full year ago, we reviewed Taphive’s ToDoMovies 2.0. Since that time, technology has improved and Apple released iOS 7. In response, Taphive updated their movie app to match.
* TodoMovies 3 is a movie discovery app that lets you keep track of what you want to see in the future, what you’ve already seen before, and find out relevant news about the film industry…
* Just like its predecessor, this app is clean, sleek, and elegant. The user interface is perfectly designed to appeal to your senses. Tap to see a movie poster. Tap again to read about it. Everything you need is easy to find and one tap away.
* From the main menu, you can browse movies, read news, and check your watch list. Tap Discover to see the available movies. Movies are listed by Genres, In Theaters, and Upcoming. Tap one section to see more. When you enter a section, you will see movies, displayed by their official film poster. Tap a movie to see the poster up close.
* In the full poster view, you can play the trailer, view the image gallery, add the movie to your watch list, share a link with others, and visit the store to see a list of everything available related to the title.
* If you want to read a synopsis of the movie, tap the menu button in the upper right corner. You’ll see a critic rating, the movie summary, the release date, and other pertinent information.
* Scroll down to see the cast list. Tap on an actor to read his or her biography and list of movies. From here, you can add other movies to your watch list. For example, from the new “Avengers: Age of Ultron” movie, I tapped on Robert Downey Jr. to see his list of movies. Then, I found a film he was in that I have not yet seen, so I added it to my “To Watch” list.
* From the main menu screen, tap News to read up on celebrity gossip, movie rumors, and general information about the industry. Emma Watson is rumored to star in a live-action version of “The Little Mermaid.” Find out if it’s true. Did you know that the Wachowskis are making another movie?

* The best way to get started exploring and discovering movies is to browse titles to add to your watch list. Under Genres, you’ll see movies listed by category, like action, comedy, horror, and foreign. Tap a genre to see the list.
* Then, find a movie you’ve either seen or want to see and tap its poster. Tap the play button to watch the trailer. Tap the gallery icon to see movie stills and fan art. Tap the plus (+) button to add it to your To Watch list. The font and icon color will turn blue when you add it to your To Watch list. If the movie has not yet premiered in theaters, you can set a reminder to notify you at a specific time on or near its release date.
* If you’ve seen the movie, tap the button a second time to add it to your “Watched” list. The font and icon color will turn green.
* If you want to buy the soundtrack, preorder the digital movie, or download a related app, tap the store icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. It looks like a purse. Each movie will have a selection of items that can be purchased in Apple’s iTunes store. There are soundtracks, digital downloads, ebooks, apps, and more. Not every item is directly related to the movie. It appears that the store populates the list based on the search term. For example, under “Gravity,” I saw a book about a Jewish teenager from Canada, an endless runner game, and the Disney Channel app.
* To read up on news about the film industry, go back to the main menu by tapping the back arrow in the top left corner of the screen and then tap News.
* In the news section, articles are divided by General, Movies, and Celebrity. In the General section, you can find out about box office numbers, read interviews, and watch movie clips. In the Movies section, read about upcoming films, find out about theater premiers, and watch blooper reels. In the Celebrity section, get all the latest news and gossip about your favorite actors and actresses.

* The app’s user interface is sleek and convenient. There is a lot to discover about movies and actors and this app makes finding them easy. It almost feels like you are following a tree branch to new films and celebrities.
* This app features a very comprehensive list of current, old, and upcoming movies.
* When I tried to add movies to my Watched list by tapping the button a second time, it showed that I added them, but when I went to my Watched list, those movies were not there. They were still in the To Watch list.
* I wish this app connected to Fandango, or some other ticket buying service, so you could order movie tickets.
* ToDoMovies 3 is free. There is no greater value than zero dollars. If you are a fan of film and oftentimes find yourself trying to keep track of movies you want to see or ones you’ve seen before, this is a great system for taking care of your needs.
* Moviegoers of all types should check this app out. Even if you don’t go to the theater that often, you’d be surprised at how quickly you will find yourself adding titles to your To Watch list. I didn’t even know they were making a sequel to “300” and now it’s on my list of movies to watch. Download it in the App Store today.
* Now that Apple has updated it to include Push Notification, iTunes Movie Trailers offers many of the same features.
