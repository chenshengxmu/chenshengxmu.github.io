* One-on-one video calls have always been free on Skype and now the Microsoft-owned communication platform is making the group video calling feature, unveiled in 2010, available free of charge to desktop users running OS X or Microsoft Windows, with no expiration date, as well as to owners of the Xbox One console which has Skype deeply integrated.
* Up until now, group video calling used to be limited to Skype’s Premium users on Windows desktop and Mac, which costs $4.99 for a day pass or $8.99 per month. Microsoft has said it will make the feature free on all platforms “in the future”…
* According to the Skype blog, in the future the team will be “enabling group video calling for all our users across more platforms – at no cost.

* Mac and PC desktop users can start multi-party video chats with up to ten participants. On the Xbox One, up to four devices are supported.
* Here’s a quick video overview of group video calling on Windows.
* Phillip Snalune, Skype’s General Manager of Consumer Product Marketing, told The Next Web that the following platforms will support free group video calling in the future: Windows Metro, Windows Phone, Android and iOS.
* None of the aforementioned platforms currently support the feature so this’ll mark the first time multi-party video chats have become available on the iPhone and iPad.
* The Windows giant moving from paid to free for group video calling probably has a lot to do with the fact that Google’s Hangouts offers muli-party video chatting free of charge.
* Skype’s free iPhone and iPad apps are free downloads in the App Store.
