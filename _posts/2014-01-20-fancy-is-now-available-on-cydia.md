* Fancy, the awesome jailbreak tweak that colorizes iOS 7, is now available for download on Cydia’s ModMyi repo for $0.99. The tweak, which has been highly anticipated for a couple of weeks, is from Mitch Treece, the same developer that brought us the Touch ID enabled tweak called Touchy.
* Treece labels Fancy as “the simplest way to colorize iOS 7’s incredibly dull UI.” I tend to agree. Watch our video walkthrough inside, and let me know what you think about it in the comments.
* You can find our full preview of Fancy here.
