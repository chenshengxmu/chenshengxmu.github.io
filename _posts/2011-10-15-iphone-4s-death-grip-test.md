* Remember the iPhone 4 antennagate debacle? For those of you who don’t, when Apple released the GSM iPhone 4 last year, users began to notice that when the handset was held with the left hand, connecting the two antennas, cell reception dropped significantly (this was dubbed the “death grip”), often resulting in complete signal loss.
* Although Apple tried to fix the antenna problem with a software update, the update did not completely rid the iPhone 4 of the issue. Apple then decided to give out free bumper cases, which seemed to prevent the antenna problem from occurring.
* Last week, Apple announced the new iPhone 4S, in addition to an improved 8MP camera, Siri, and new A5 processor, included a redesigned antenna…According to Apple, the iPhone 4S is the first phone that  ‘intelligently switches’ between its two antennas, providing improved call quality and faster data speeds. Additionally, it looks like the new antenna in the iPhone 4S also resolves the death grip issue.
* As seen in the video demonstration above, the iPhone 4S is not phased by the death grip, while the iPhone 4 slowly losses bars and then regains them when the phone isn’t held in the death grip.
* Aren’t you glad that you no longer have to hold your iPhone “a different way”?
