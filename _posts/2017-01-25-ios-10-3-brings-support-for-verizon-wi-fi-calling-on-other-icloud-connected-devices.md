* U.S. wireless carriers like AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile have supported Wi-Fi Calling for some time now, with AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile also supporting Wi-Fi Calling on other iCloud-connected devices like iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch and Mac. According to user reports on MacRumors’ forums, iOS 10.3 beta 1 supports Integrated Calling on Verizon.
* With this handy feature, compatible iCloud-signed devices can make and receive calls using your carrier’s account even when your iPhone isn’t nearby.
* Wi-Fi Calling on iCloud-enabled devices is supported by other U.S. carriers like MetroPCS and Simple Mobile, as well as by a few global carriers. Verizon customers should be able to take advantage of this useful feature when iOS 10.3 releases publicly.
* Apple’s support document lists various iPhone features that carriers in the United States, Europe, Asia and elsewhere currently support, including Wi-Fi Calling, FaceTime, Personal Hotspot and more.

* With Integrated Calling, you can use Wi-Fi Calling on other iCloud-connected devices even if your iPhone isn’t on the same Wi-Fi Network or turned on, as long as all devices are signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID.
* This feature, also known as Integrated Calling, requires any iPad or iPod touch model with iOS 9 or later, Apple Watch with watchOS 2 or later, or any Mac model manufactured in 2012 onward with OS X El Capitan or later.
* The feature is unavailable on Apple’s mid-2012 Mac Pro desktop.
