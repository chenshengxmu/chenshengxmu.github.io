* Apple extended its Personal Pickup service to the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c on Monday, enabling customers to check availability at their local Apple retailers and schedule in-store pickups for both of the handsets.
* The service was particularly handy for 5s shoppers, given that initial supplies were very limited, and online shipping times quickly slipped to October. But without explanation, Apple pulled the option the following day…
* As of right now, customers looking to buy an iPhone 5s from Apple are only given the options of placing an online order for delivery in October or visiting local retail stores in person to check in-store availability.
* But according to a new report from 9to5Mac, that’ll change next week. Citing anonymous sources, the site says the company will reinstate the in-store pickup option for both its app and website next Monday, Sept 30.
* Earlier this week, Apple announced that it sold 9 million iPhones during opening weekend.
