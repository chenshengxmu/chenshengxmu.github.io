* Verizon Wireless has announced the roll out of its Voice over LTE technology – better known as VoLTE – will begin across the US later this year.
* The new technology will move Verizon’s LTE service past data and will offer an HD Voice experience, using the AMR-wideband standard. “This solution provides the best voice quality available now and allows for future interoperability with others using the standard,” Verizon claims. 
* Smartphones will need to be updated to take advantage of the VoLTE feature in the coming months. It’s expected iOS 8, Apple’s next version of its mobile software on track for a September launch, will support Verizon’s new standard for better voice calling. For a customer to make or receive a VoLTE call, both parties must have VoLTE-enabled devices and be in an area where VoLTE is available. VoLTE can place phone calls and load data simultaneously.
* Verizon further announced VoLTE will offer video calling options, including the ability to change their calls instantly from voice-only to voice and video.
* AT&T announced last week that it’s introducing its own version of HD Voice to select markets starting May 23 on a voice-over-LTE network. Apple has claimed in the past that its iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s support HD Voice out of the box. T-Mobile’s HD voice solution is supported, as well.
