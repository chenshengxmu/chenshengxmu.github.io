* Apple has included diverse emojis into OS X 10.10.3 beta 2 and iOS 8.3 beta 2 that were just seeded to developers on Monday.
* Emojis have exploded in popularity after being released within iOS 5, as they’re seen as a quick way to show expression. With the change within the new betas, more ethnicities are now being supported, along with 32 new country flags. 
* Apple has taken a strong stance on adding more diverse emojis, saying in March 2014: “There needs to be more diversity in the emoji character set, and we have been working closely with the Unicode Consortium in an effort to update the standard.” As a whole, Apple has been working to take a greater stance on diversity.
* These emojis aren’t Apple specific. Rather, the Cupertino-based company just supports what the Unicode Consortium puts out.

* In the first beta of OS X 10.10.3, the pop-up emoji picker available in many apps was transitioned from a paginated layout to a single larger vertical-scrolling page. For instance, if you were to bring the emoji picker up in OS X 10.10.2 you would see just a long scrolling list of emojis. Now it’s broken into categories like on iOS.
