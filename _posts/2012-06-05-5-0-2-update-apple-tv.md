* It looks like Apple has just pushed out an update for its Apple TV, bringing the software to version 5.0.2. No details have been posted yet about the new build, numbered 9B830, but we expect Apple’s site to be updated shortly.
* Owners of second and third generation Apple TVs can download the update over the air by opening up the device’s Settings menu and selecting General > Software Update. Full changelog, once Apple posts it, after the break…
* This is the second time Apple has updated its TV software in the past month, and comes just a week before WWDC. The company is rumored to be unveiling a major software update for its set top box during the Conference.
* As usual, Apple TV 2 users who are jailbroken are encouraged to refrain from updating until we can confirm that it’s safe to do so. There’s a chance that the new software patches or inadvertently breaks the current exploit.
* iOS 5.0.2 can be download from our downloads section.
