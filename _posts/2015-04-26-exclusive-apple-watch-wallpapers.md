* This past week marks the Apple Watch release date, April 24, 2015. Although the date has come under fire, at least a few pre-orders were filled and May/June ship dates are seeing movement. Since the pre-order launch on April 10, Apple removed the April 24 date from the online Apple Stores and Angela Ahrendts released an internal memo all but confirming in-store sales are not going to happen until around June.
* Inside, we have the single largest wallpaper selection in an iDB post. Thanks to some great work by Jason Zigrino and Efrain Roa, there are enough images in there to keep you busy while waiting for your device. There are images for iPhone, iPad, and desktop in a wide range of colors that will match any new Apple Watch you are hoping to have in your hands.
* The first two sets of wallpapers are from a growing iDB crowd favorite, Jason Zigrino. He is now a frequent addition to the Wallpapers of the Week and has even more to offer on his Deviant Art gallery or regular updates via @JasonZigrino. To begin, Jason provides his take on an earlier set of wallpapers we posted. Each Apple Watch, when paired, provides a specific confirmation logo and is genuine to the individual device, whether Sport, Watch, or Edition. To download all of the variants and devices in a single shot, the ZIP file is hosted via Deviant Art.

* Jason’s next set is inspired by the Apple Watch icon set. As you know by now, the Apple Watch Home screen utilizes an app cluster as opposed to a grid. The cluster focuses around the center icon, which is the actual watch face clock app. Below is a set of images reminiscent of that same app cluster. If you are looking for the whole lot in a single download, the ZIP file is hosted via Deviant Art.

* If you missed out three weeks ago, we also featured a large set of Apple Watch inspired images for our Wallpapers of the Week. Some of the walls echo the Apple Watch certification spirograph seen above. Others are a recreation of an actual watch face.
