* If you’re a student on the lookout for an iPhone this holiday season, look no further than Best Buy and Sprint which teamed up for a cool smartphone promotion. Beginning today and valid until January 4, eligible students who purchase an eligible Sprint phone at Best Buy stores, at the student-activated price, and sign up for one of Sprint’s plans will received twelve months of free service which includes unlimited talk, text and one gigabyte of data.
* This normally costs $70 per month so the free year of service could save you a total of $840. Jump past the fold for the full reveal…
* According to Sprint’s media release, eligible students who purchase a Sprint phone between November 18, 2013 and January 7, 2014 are required to sign up for Sprint’s Unlimited or My Way to get twelve free months of talk, text and data.
* Considering this is normally a $70 per month value, it’s a tempting offer.

* Phones eligible for the Sprint Student offer include the $699 16GB iPhone 5s, for example.
* Yes, that’s actually $50 more compared to Apple’s standard no-contract $699 price. Likewise, the $749/$849 32/64GB iPhone 5s will set you back $799 and $899 in this promotion, respectively.
* The iPhone 5c and 4s models also cost an extra $50. However, this slight premium will offset itself right off the bat, after your first month of service.
* Additionally, students can add another line for $10 a month. The promotion is available exclusively for students at Best Buy and Best Buy Mobile stores across the country.
* More information is available at the Best Buy website.
* Note that the standard $36 activation fee, taxes and Sprint surcharges apply. Another caveat: the 1GB of free data is for smartphones only and is blocked on basic phones.
