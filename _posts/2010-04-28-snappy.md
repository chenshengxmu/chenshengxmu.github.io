---
* Have you ever missed a great picture because your iPhone camera app was to slow to launch? If so, then read on because Snappy might be the answer to your frustration.
* Snappy is a jailbreak app available from Cydia that allows you to quicky launch the camera app simply by tapping and holding the status bar.
* Look at this demo to see how Snappy works.
* Snappy is the kind of app that makes me wonder why Apple hasn’t implemented this yet. I mean, it’s pretty basic, yet very useful.
* Have you tried Snappy yet? What’s your take on it?
