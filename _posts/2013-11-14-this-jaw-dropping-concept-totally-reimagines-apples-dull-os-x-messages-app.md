* The iDB team very much depends on Apple’s Messages app as our day-to-day communications tool to keep everyone on the same page. Disregarding for a moment the ongoing iMessage reliability issues, the Messages app that comes bundled with OS X feels terribly outdated both design and feature-wise, even in Mavericks.
* Basically nothing has changed since the iChat days apart from iMessage integration and a few questionable UI tweaks adding up to the overall clunkiness.
* Thinking differently about the software, Palo Alto, California-based user interface designer Denis Pakhaliuk has envisioned a remarkable concept which has immediately left me speechless and wanting for more.
* The awesomeness is right after the break…
* Check out the renderings.
* Looks awesome on any background!

* I’m loving a lot those flattened window buttons in the upper left corner! And this below is what the designer thought the chat interface should look like.

* The ability to continuously sync and filter iMessage-enabled contacts from my Address Book would be much welcomed. Facebook’s newly-overhauld Messenger app has a similar feature that syncs your iPhone contacts so you could message people who you’re not friends with on Facebook.

* I am a big fan of translucency in iOS 7 and hope Apple brings it soon to OS X.
* Can we have true translucency in OS X ‘Syrah’, perhaps?

* And finally, I absolutely adore how this concepts adopts the Mac OS X desktop color scheme. Smart colors, indeed!

* I for one would very gladly message people all day long using such an eye-candy app.

* In my personal opinion, Pakhaliuk’s work here is leaps and bounds better than Apple’s amateur-looking Messages for Mac. Just to reiterate, Apple’s app lacks instant syncing between devices, filters, media uploads UI and enhanced indicators for statuses – all the great features envisioned by this particular concept.
* Additional renderings are available at Behance.net so do check them out and come back here to join us in comments.
