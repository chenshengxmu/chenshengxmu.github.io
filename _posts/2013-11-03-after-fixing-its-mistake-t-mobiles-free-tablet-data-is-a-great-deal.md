title: After fixing its mistake, T-Mobile's free tablet data is a great deal

* Yesterday I wrote a post going at T-Mobile pretty hard after it appeared to do the ‘ol bait and switch on its free 200MB/month data claims. I wasn’t alone. Numerous customers complained that T-Mobile reps were insisting that they sign up for a monthly plan in order to take advantage of the free data offer.
* As it turns out, that was a mistake; a costly one as far as overall perception goes, but nonetheless a mistake. T-Mobile’s CEO clarified things yesterday via Twitter, and the company appeared to iron out any miscommunication between corporate and those on the front lines.
* I’m very happy about this. Not so much due to the free data — everyone knows that 200MB on an LTE network is the equivalent to raving about skiing down a 10 foot slope — yes you went down fast, but it didn’t last very long. I’m happy because T-Mobile owned up to its mistake, and did what it said it’d do.
* So, of course, I decided to return the Wi-Fi only iPad Air that I had purchased yesterday in disgust, and went with a 32GB cellular iPad with a T-Mobile SIM conveniently bundled in. In fact, it was so convenient that I didn’t even have to set a foot inside a T-Mobile store.
* After finishing the exchange, I simply unboxed my iPad, turned it on, and went through iOS’ customary new setup process. During the process I was prompted to create a new T-Mobile account. No credit cards were ever needed for the setup, and I was issued my free 200MB of LTE “starter” data.
* T-Mobile made the process painless and easy, and the fact that no credit card was required for the setup solidifies this as a great deal. You can even choose to use the free 200MB with iOS’ Personal Hotspot feature.
* Indeed, I was pretty ticked off yesterday when it appeared that T-Mobile wasn’t actually doing something new, and appeared to be sticking to the oft-shady script of wireless carriers.
* Today, I’m happy to say that I was wrong.
