* If you have an older device running older firmware, you may have felt left out of yesterday’s iOS 7 jailbreak festivities. But, worry not, because there is a release that just dropped in Cydia that allows you to enjoy an untethered jailbreak on your iPhone 4, iPod touch 4th generation, and iPhone 3GS if you’re running iOS 6.1.3 through 6.1.5.
* The untethered jailbreak, which is called p0sixspwn in Cydia, is a package that allows you to convert a tethered jailbreak into an untethered one. This means that if you’re currently jailbroken on one of the aforementioned devices using a tool like redSn0w or sn0wbreeze, you can finally reboot your device without having to perform a tethered boot. Have a look inside for the step-by-step guide.
* How to untether iOS 6.1.3-6.1.5 on the 3GS, iPhone 4, or iPod touch 4G
* Step 1: Perform a tethered jailbreak with RedSn0w or sn0wbreeze Step 2: Open Cydia, search for p0sixspwn and install the package. Step 3: Enjoy your newly converted untethered jailbreak.
* The team behind p0sixspwn—@winocm and @iH8sn0w—claim that their jailbreak is of the “drama free” variety, an obvious friendly jab at the controversy surrounding the Evaders’ release of Evasi0n7. They also state that they plan to bring a jailbreak to A5+ devices running the older iOS 6 firmware.
* p0sixspwn looks to be a solid release, and shouldn’t be lost in the hullabaloo surrounding yesterday’s surprise release of Evasi0n7. Be sure to check out iH8sn0w’s blog for more details on the jailbreak.
