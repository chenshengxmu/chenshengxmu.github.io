* A week ago, a report surfaced from Israeli news outlet Calcalist claiming that Apple had reached an acquisition deal with the 3D sensor tech company PrimeSense. The purchase wasn’t final, but the outlet seemed pretty confident it was close.
* Today, Globes adds it weight to the story with its own report. Thepublication—who has a solid track record of providing accurate intel regarding high-level buyout talks—says the deal was completed Friday and will be announced next week…
* Here’s the Globes’ Shmulik Shelach (via The Next Web) with the scoop:
* “On Friday, the acquisition of Israeli gesture recognition company PrimeSense Ltd. by Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) was closed. The deal, which has not been formally announced, was made at a company value of $300-350 million, and follows lengthy negotiations by PrimeSense with several potential buyers.
* PrimeSense, founded in 2005 by president Aviad Maizels, CTO Alexander Shpunt, Dima Rais, Ophir Sharon, and Tamir Berliner, is run by CEO Inon Beracha. The start-up’s five founders are expected to rake in $50-85 million from the acquisition.”
* Apple has been rumored to be buying PrimeSense since back in July, but this time around it sounds like it’s more than just pillow talk. Earlier this week, AllThingsD cited independent sources in a report saying the deal was close to complete.

* PrimeSense is best known for its work with Microsoft, who used its tech inside the first Kinect sensor for the Xbox 360. But the company also sells its own 3D sensors and software for use in other markets such as as TV, mobile, and robotics.
* Of course, what Apple plans to do with PrimeSense’s tech is still a mystery, but it’s fun to speculate. The most popular theory is that it’s going to integrate it into a future TV product which would allow users to control it with air gestures.
* Update: AllThingsD has confirmation from Apple:
* “Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet confirmed the PrimeSense deal with the boilerplate comment the company typically provides when news of one of its acquisitions leaks: “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.”
