* If you go to GoDaddy.com right now and do a search for the JailbreakMe.com domain name, you will get a message telling you that this domain is up for sale in an auction opened to anyone to bid on.
* It shows that the site has been appraised at $316 but the current auction price is $2,500. The auction, scheduled to end on July 16, will probably go much higher than that considering the value of this domain name.
* But why is JailbreakMe.com for sale, and who is selling it?
* Doing a quick WhoIs search for the domain name doesn’t give us much information as it is currently privately registered. But isn’t Comex the owner of this domain? I personally don’t think so. JailbreakMe.com has been online for a few years now and I think the original owner of the domain still is the current owner, who’s kindly letting Comex use the domain.
* I do not have any evidence to prove that but I do remember Comex mentioning something about this situation when he first released his own JailbreakMe jailbreak almost a year ago.
* Now why would JailbreakMe.com be up for sale? I have absolutely no idea.
* What I know for sure is what’s going to happen to JailbreakMe.com. The site is going to sell for a hefty price. Some content scraper scumbag will buy it and turn it into a spammy site, just like ultrasn0w.ca or geohot.ca. Heck, look what happened to ziPhone.org.
* It’s too bad, but at the end of the day, it’s just a domain name.
* What do you think?
* Update: Yup, I was right. Comex just confirmed that he doesn’t own JailbreakMe.com. iH8Sn0w speculates that Nicholas Penree, the original creator of JailbreakMe still owns the site, as I explained above.
