* If you’re looking to simplify the look of Notification Center, then SimpleNC is probably up to the task. It is a tweak that features tons of switches, which allows you to disable specific Notification Center assets individually. The wonderful thing about SimpleNC is that it gives the user choice. You can go the subtle route, and only simplify bits and pieces of Notification Center, or you can go to extremes, and give it a makeover that you won’t soon forget.
* As you can see from the image at the top of this post, SimpleNC, when taken to extremes, can result in a pretty undesirable and downright radical look. It’s best to approach the tweak with balance, and strategically select assets to enable or disable. This is easily accomplished by means of the tweak’s preferences, which feature a list of switches that you can quickly enable or disable. Once you do, a simple respring will set the changes in action.

* I’ll be honest with you and say that I’ve never been a big fan of tweaks that feature preference panels with a long list of switches, and that doesn’t change with SimpleNC. I wish that the preferences contained a more intelligent way of communicating what the switches do, and a less awkward way of enacting and viewing those changes. As it stands now, you’ll need to respring each time to make sure each change is fully applied.
* With that said, SimpleNC is still a great way to go in and tinker with the look of Notification Center. Its granular controls assure the end user of the utmost amount of customization, and if that’s what you’re looking for then it hard to argue against it.
* SimpleNC is available freely on Cydia. What do you think?
