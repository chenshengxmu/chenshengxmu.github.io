* The latest update for the Netflix iPhone app just hit the App Store. It now boasts video-out capabilities for the iPhone 4 and iPod touch 4th generation. This update is huge for those of us who use out iDevice for everything.
* I’m a little curious if this will make any difference in quality for those on the 3G/3GS using DisplayOut, TVOut2, or Resupported. Regardless, I’m excited to test out the new functionality, and may opt for some extension cables to make my iPhone AV cable reach the TV from the couch.
