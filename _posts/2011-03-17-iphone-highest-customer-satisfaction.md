* For the 5th time in a row, Apple is ranking #1 in a customer satisfaction survey conducted by JD Power. The iPhone scored 795 out of 1,000 points, which is slightly lower than the 800 points it had scored in the same survey a few months ago.
* Closely followed by Motorola (763) and HTC (762), the iPhone performs particularly well in ease of operation, operating system, features and physical design. This score is obviously not a surprise to anyone who owns an iPhone…
* Palm, Nokia, Samsung, and BlackBerry scored below the industry average, which makes me want to point my finger at them and say “ha ha”.
* Surprised?
