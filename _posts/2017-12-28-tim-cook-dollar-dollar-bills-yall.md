* Apple CEO Tim Cook earned just over $100 million this year, Bloomberg reports. The news was spotted in the company’s latest proxy statement, which was filed Wednesday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of its February shareholders meeting.
* Cook received 3.06 million in salary, $9.33 million in bonuses—a 74% increase in his annual bonus—and shares of stock worth $89.2 million. The total package comes out to roughly $102 million, which should keep the CEO in the running for the highest paid executive.
* Other interesting details from the filing:
* As usual, details regarding what Apple paid Chief Design Officer Jony Ive were missing from the filing. There’s been a lot of speculation over the years on why Ive’s compensation remains a secret—some believe that it could be substantially higher than the other executives.
