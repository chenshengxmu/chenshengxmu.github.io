* Two days after it launched iOS 12 beta 7 to developers only to pull the update over performance issues, Apple’s trying once again. The company just released the software as iOS 12 beta 8 with a new build number. Developers can download the new update over-the-air (OTA) or from the Apple Developer website. 
* On Monday, Apple released seventh betas for tvOS 12, watchOS 5, and macOS Mojave, as well as the pulled iOS 12 beta 7. The highlight of these betas was Apple’s decision to remove Group Facetime from iOS 12 and macOS Mojave. The heavily advertised new feature won’t launch now until later in the fall.
