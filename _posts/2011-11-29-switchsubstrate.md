* One of my favorite things about SBSettings is the Mobile Substrate Addons feature that allows you to selectively disable a jailbreak tweak temporarily.
* But wouldn’t it be cool if we could disable every Mobile Substrate Addon with one fell swoop? Well, now you can. Introducing SwitchSubstrate, a jailbreak app that allows you to disable all of your Mobile Substrate tweaks with the simple tap of a button…
* Disabling your Mobile Substrate tweaks allows you to quickly troubleshoot issues with conflicts, and in some cases will make your device run faster if a tweak was previously slowing it down.
* It’s nice to use SBSettings to selectively disable certain tweaks and apps, but it’s also handy to be able to take them out all at once — the hallmark feature of SwitchSubstrate.
* SwitchSubstrate has yet to appear on Cydia, but according to the developer it should be there in the near future and it will be downloadable free of charge. Until then, check out the video of SwitchSubstrate in action, and let us know what you think about it.
