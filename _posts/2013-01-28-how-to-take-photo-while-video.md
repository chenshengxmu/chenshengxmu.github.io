* A new iPhone always come with a number of new features. It’s usually both thinner and lighter than its predecessor, it’s faster, and it has an improved camera.
* One of the iPhone’s smaller, lesser talked about features is the fact that it can snap photos while the phone is recording a video. Of course, a lot of you probably already know about this. But for those that don’t, we’ll show you how.
* As you’d expect, it’s extremely simple. All you have to do is open up your Camera app, switch to video mode, and start recording. You should then see a camera icon pop up in one of the corners (depends on iPhone’s orientation).
* Tap on this button as you record the video to shoot still frames, which will be saved to your Camera roll like any other photo.
* I could see this coming in handy in a number of situations, such as a parent videotaping their child at a sporting event. It’d allow them to grab the perfect action shot, without stopping the recording.
* Sure, there’s nothing ground-breaking here. But if you didn’t know, now you know.
