* Most of the tweaks that have come out for Notification Center have focused solely on function. BlurriedNCBackground is a jailbreak tweak that puts function aside in favor of looks.
* And it looks good; real good. If you want to add a blurred background to your Notification Center, then check out the video inside for more details on this interesting visual tweak…
* There are three options contained in BlurriedNCBackground’s settings panel: the ability to adjust the amount of blur, the divide ratio, and asynchronous blurring mode.
* The most interesting option is asynchronous blur mode, because it forces the blur only after the Notification Center is completely loaded. Otherwise, there is a slight delay when invoking Notification Center due to the fact that blur must be applied first.
* If you’re a jailbroken iOS 5 user, then you definitely want to check out this awesome tweak on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Not only is it free, but it’s a great alternative to the stagnant linen background.
* Let me know what you think in the comment section below.
