* BannerSwipe is an extremely simple jailbreak tweak that allows you to quickly dismiss banner notifications using a swipe gesture. The tweak includes a fluid banner dismiss animation to go along with its gesture.
* While it’s true that you don’t necessarily need a tweak like this to quickly dismiss banner notifications with a swipe gesture, BannerSwipe’s main draw is the included dismissal animation. Want to see how the animation looks in action? Check our our video walkthrough…
* Once installed, there are no options or settings to configure for BannerSwipe. Once you receive a notification banner, swipe from right to left on the banner to dismiss it. You may also swipe from left to right after you begin the right to left motion as shown in the video walkthrough above.
* I like BannerSwipe. True, it’s extremely simple, but sometimes simple is best. What do you think? Share your thoughts in the comment section down below.
