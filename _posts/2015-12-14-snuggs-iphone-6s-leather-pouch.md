* Recently, a friend of mine pulled this slim leather pouch out of his pocket. I didn’t know what it was, but I knew I liked the way it looked. Turns out, it was a case for his iPhone 6s.
* Snugg’s Leather Pouch has that “wow factor” that protects your iPhone 6s, while looking pretty dang hip when you take it out of your pocket. It’s slim and sleek and has a soft lining to “hug” your smartphone.
* The pouch is made from bi-cast leather so it looks good, but is easier to keep clean. The interior is made from soft Nubuck leather for additional protection for the iPhone’s screen.
* It has an elastic pull strap attached to the inside that makes it easier to get your iPhone 6s out of the case. Simply pull the strap and it will lift your device. When you are finished, the strap will snap back into place thanks to the magnetic tip. It also has a card slot on the backside to keep an ID, bankcards, or cash.
* The Snugg Leather Pouch is available on Amazon in a variety of colors, including black, brown, pink, blue, and more. It ranges in price from $7 to $15, depending on your color preference. There is a version for the iPhone 6s Plus in a variety of colors for between $7 and $18.
