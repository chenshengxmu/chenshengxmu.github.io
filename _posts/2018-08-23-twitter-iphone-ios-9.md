* Twitter yesterday quietly bumped its iPhone and iPad app on App Store to version 7.3. Aside from a pair of user improvements, the update has removed support for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices powered by the iOS 9 software or older.
* “We are streamlining our app development for all clients,” the company wrote in the changelog. “As a result, devices on iOS 9 or older will no longer receive updates from Twitter.”
* As of version 7.3, the app requires iOS 10.0 or later.
* According to Apple’s App Store dashboard at the time of this writing, iOS 9 and older iOS editions (lumped collectively  into the ‘Other’ category) were powering about 5% of devices.
* It’s not like Twitter’s move is going to hurt a lot to people.
* Folks who still run iOS 9 should update their devices to the iOS 10 software or newer to continue receiving the latest feature updates, performance improvements and bug fixes.

* Other updates in Twitter 7.3 for iOS include unspecified improvements to the tweet composer, Home timeline and direct-messaging feature, plus a bunch of accessibility-focused enhancements, including rotor support for links within tweets, an improved VoiceOver experience for iOS 11 users and improved Braille support.
* Twitter’s been making some developer and user-hostile moves in the past year.
* The company has pulled its native Mac app from Mac App Store although this isn’t such a major issue given how rarely it was updated. Besides, there are several capable third-party Twitter clients available on macOS that can come to the rescue.
* Tweetbot and Twitterrific, for example, are the two best Twitter alternatives in my personal opinion. However, given that the company is no longer providing its streaming APIs to third-party developers, unofficial apps have now lost some crucial features, like receiving push notifications for tweets posted by specific accounts and more.
* Twitter for iOS is a free download from App Store.
