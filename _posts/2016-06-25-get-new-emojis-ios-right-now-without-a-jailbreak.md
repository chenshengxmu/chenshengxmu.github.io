* Many of you probably already heard the news that Unicode 9.0 became official this week and that there were going to be 72 new emojis coming soon.
* Although Apple is likely to add support for these new emojis in iOS 10 in a future beta or release update, they’re not yet available in iOS whatsoever, but in this tutorial, we’ll show you how you can still use them without a jailbreak on a completely stock device.
* It doesn’t matter whether you’re on iOS 9 or even if you’re in the latest iOS 10 beta. Apple hasn’t added support for the new Emojis that are a part of Unicode 9.0 just yet. With that being said, anyone can benefit from adding these new emojis manually.
* If you want to get them, you could certainly wait until Apple is good and ready to implement them, or you could follow these steps to get them right now:
* 1) Launch Safari on your iOS device and visit the following link to load the website with all the new emojis:

* 2) Scroll down until you see the line starting with the word “emojis” just above the actual emoji images.
* 3) Highlight all of the Emojis by tapping and holding on the word “emojis” and then dragging the selector all the way down, then tap on the Copy button.
* 4) Next, you’ll open the Notes app on your iOS device and you’ll create a new note.

* 5) Paste everything into the new note.
* 6) Now to test it out, tap and hold on one of the emojis you see and then tap on the Copy button.
* 7) Go ahead and start a new conversation with someone in the Messages app and Paste the emoji into the text field of the app.

* 8) Tap the Send button and the emoji should send to that person.
* They will be able to see it no matter what version of iOS they’re running because it was sent as a tiny image file. Both iMessage and SMS are compatible with sending images so long as your phone and carrier support it.
* You may not be adding a slew of new emojis to iOS’ built-in Emoji keyboard itself, but with this method, you can at least still enjoy sending the new emojis to people before Apple actually implements it.
* They can be shared across a variety of platforms, including Facebook Messenger and other messaging platforms that support sending image files.
* Are you excited to see if Apple adopts the new emojis in a future version of iOS 10? Share in the comments!
