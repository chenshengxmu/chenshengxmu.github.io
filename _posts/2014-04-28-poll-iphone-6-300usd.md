* iPhone 6 rumors are heating up as we inch closer to Apple’s summer developers conference and an assumed Fall launch of a 4.7-inch iPhone 6.
* Jefferies analyst Peter Misek recently claimed in a note to clients that Apple is negotiating with wireless carriers to raise the iPhone 6 price by $100, because the handset will be “the only headline-worthy high-end phone launched this year.
* The price hike would make the larger-screened iPhone retail for $299 after a two-year contract with a  carrier versus the usual $199 starting price of latest on-contract iPhones. Interestingly enough, a recent study has found that one-third of iPhone shoppers would indeed pay more to  get an iPhone with a screen larger than four inches.
* What about you?
* Misek’s analyst note was first shared by StreetInsider, here’s the quote:
* The possibility may at first seem far-fetched in light of investor concerns regarding possible carrier subsidy and handset price cuts due to smartphone saturation and lack of differentiation.
* But we think this general lack of differentiation could be the reason why Apple may be able to get a price increase. Carriers realize that the iPhone 6 will likely be the only headline-worthy high-end phone launched this year and that they will lose subs if they do not offer it.
* Here, cast your vote below.
* Yes, we’ve switched from PollDady to PolarB for polls – let us know how you liked the new system down in the comments.
* Just a quick observation: Apple typically keeps price points of products intact as it refreshed them with new technologies. With the iPhone accounting for more than a half of its revenues and considering the smartphone saturation on the high-end, the iPhone 6 price increase should only be analyzed in the context of widening the price umbrella and thus the addressable market.
* That is, come this Fall the current-generation iPhone 5s lineup should drop to $99 while the iPhone 5c, now $99, should go free and replace the iPhone 4s as a new entry-level option.
* At the same time, Apple should be wise to also refresh the iPhone 5s because there should be a four-inch iPhone occupying the slot currently taken by the $199 iPhone 5s.
* Only then would it make sense for a larger-screened model to command a $100 premium, similar to how full-size iPads are pricier than the iPad mini models.
* It would make absolutely no sense to make the iPhone more expensive for consumers while killing the current $199 price point/four inch form factor.
* So don’t be shy – feel free to articulate your vote and share it with fellow readers in the comments below.
