* The cartoon service Boomerang on Thursday announced the release of a streaming app for the fourth-generation Apple TV, bringing classic cartoons like Wacky Races, Yogi Bear, Scooby-Doo and many others to Apple’s set-top box.
* The service is also adding support for Google’s Chromecast and Amazon’s Fire TV HDMI dongles. Roku devices will be added in the coming weeks.
* Boomerang originally launched its premium video subscription service in April.
* You can subscribe to Boomerang for $5 per month, or $40 per year, to access exclusive shows and new episodes of cartoons, as well as enjoy Boomerang’s on-demand archive of 5,000+ movies and TV shows from Hanna-Barbera, Looney Tunes and MGM animation catalogs.
* A 7-day free trial of Boomerang is available.
* Boomerang also launched the new original series “Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz from” Warner Bros. Animation, with the first thirteen episodes now available for streaming via their service.
* The app’s App Store description notes that Boomerang is only accessible in the United States “where a high-speed broadband connection is available” (well, I live in Croatia and we have a very high-speed broadband over here as well).
* Download Boomerang for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV from App Store.
