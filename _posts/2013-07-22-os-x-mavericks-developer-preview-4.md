* Apple has seeded the 4th developer preview of OS X Mavericks, and it’s available for download right now. The download, which comes in at about 1.27GB for users of OS X Mavericks DP 3, can be found via the Mac App Store app. For those of you not yet running OS X Mavericks, the download would normally be available through the Mac Dev Center, but it’s been down as a part of a well publicized security breach.

* As you can see, I’m still in the midst of downloading the update, but I’ll be sure to report back with new screenshots and updates upon its completion.
* Here is the new setup screen:
