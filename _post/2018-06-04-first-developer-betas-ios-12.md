* Shortly after its WWDC 2018 keynote address ended on Monday, Apple seeded the first betas of iOS 12, macOS Mojave, tvOS 12 and watchOS 5 to developers. Registered developers can download the new updates from the Dev Center, or over-the-air after installing the necessary certificates.
* As per usual this time of year, these four updates are massive. iOS 12 includes new notification features, new Animoji, a new Shortcuts app for Siri and a number of under-the-hood improvements. macOS Mojave has even more user-facing changes, with an all-new Dark Mode and several new apps.
* watchOS 5 and tvOS 12 are also fairly big updates, with the former adding a new Walkie-Talkie app and tons of new fitness features, and the latter bringing about support for the Dolby Atmos standard to the Apple TV 4K model and a new Zero Sign-On feature to streamline access to third-party content.
* As usual, we will be installing today’s betas and will report back if we spot anything new that wasn’t pointed out specifically during today’s keynote. Also note that there is a lot to unpack with all of these software updates, so be sure to check back with iDB in the coming hours and days for more info!
