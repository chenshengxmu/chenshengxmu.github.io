* Twitter is making it a lot easier to send direct messages to anyone right from your timeline with today’s introduction of an inline button that’s present on all tweets. The new Direct Message button is launching later today in Twitter’s mobile applications for iOS and Android.
* Conveniently located to the right of the Reply, Retweet and Like buttons below any tweet, tapping it attaches a tweet to a Direct Message, ready to be sent to one or more of your followers.
* The new button is the result of feedback from users who complained that it could be easier to share a tweet using Twitter’s direct messaging feature. “So now—in just a few taps—you can share unique Twitter content from your timeline right into your private conversation,” said the firm.

* The micro-blogging startup saw the number of Direct Messages exchanged through its platform grow sixty percent in 2015. The number of tweets shared privately in Direct Messages has grown 200 percent in just the second half of last year.
* Twitter is a free download from the App Store.
