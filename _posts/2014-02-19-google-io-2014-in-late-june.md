* Google senior vice president Sundar Pichai just announced via Google+ that the company’s annual I/O event is scheduled for June 25-26 this year. For those unfamiliar with the conference, it’s a lot like Apple’s yearly WWDC gathering in San Francisco.
* The timing is particularly interesting in that Google held I/O in May last year, well before Apple’s WWDC event. It would seem that this time the search giant is hoping to get a glimpse at what Apple has cooked up this year before divulging all of its own secrets…
* From Pichai’s Google+ page (via The Verge):
* Only 126 days until the 7th annual Google I/O, when we come together with amazing developers like you to talk about what’s next. On June 25-26, 2014, we’ll be broadcasting live from Moscone West. You can join us in person in San Francisco or remotely, via a live stream and through I/O Extended community events around the world.”
* Pichai goes on to note that Google has changed up its registration process this year. It’s implemented a new system that will randomly select successful applicants from a pool, rather than forcing attendees to scramble for tickets—an issue for WWDC-goers as well.
* As for what’s going to be announced, no details were given, but it’s widely believed that it’s going to unveil Android 5.0. Like Apple, Google saves full-numbered releases for larger upgrades, so the expectation is that it’s going to include some major new features.  
* As usual, we’ll be watching the live stream of I/O and reporting back with anything worth noting. Last year’s event included Google Glass-clad skydivers and stunt bikers who performed nerve-wracking tricks. So at the very least, the thing should be entertaining.
* Apple has yet to announce the dates for WWDC this year, but it typically falls within the first two weeks of June.
