* Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities is out with a report on Friday that’s extremely bearish on the state of Apple’s iPad. The analyst, who expects Apple to release a new 12.9-inch model in the coming months, says the downward trend of iPad sales to continue, as much as 30 percent in 2015.
* Kuo believes iPad shipments will “struggle to top” 45 million units in 2015, which is a 30 percent year over year decline from 2014. The first quarter of the year is said to be particularly bad, with a prediction that shipments will decline 52.7 percent in the first quarter of calendar 2015 to just 10.1 million units.
* It gets worse in Q2 2015, with the analyst predicting another 30 to 40 percent to between 7 million and 8 million units. That will make a year for the steepest iPad declines since the tablet was released in 2010.
* The 12.9-inch model, rumored to be called the iPad Pro, will be released in late-2015, according to the analyst. Even though it opens up virtually a new product category for the company, Kuo doesn’t believe it will have a major impact on iPad sales right off the bat.
* Last quarter, Apple posted iPad sales of 21.4 million versus 26 million last year – not as bad as what Kuo predicts to come.
* Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, thinks more partnerships in the enterprise space will help the iPad grow.
* “The issue is not a market share number, because our market share is extremely high. The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking, are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce,” Cook said speaking on the company’s quarterly earnings call last week.
