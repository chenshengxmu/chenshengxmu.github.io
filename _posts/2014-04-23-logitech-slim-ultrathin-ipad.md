* In response to the recent release of Office for iPad, Logitech yesterday announced a new version of its wildly popular Ultrathin iPad keyboard case. The new version improves on the design of its predecessor, with a thinner, lighter and more flexible design.
* If you haven’t seen an Ultrathin before, it’s a Bluetooth keyboard for your iPad that doubles as a protective cover. It’s designed from aluminum to match the rear casing of Apple’s tablet, and the keyboard offers comfortable key spacing and iOS shortcuts…
* Here’s an excerpt from Logitech’s press release:
* The Logitech Ultrathin improves the flexibility and design of its predecessor with an even thinner and lighter keyboard cover and new flexible multi-angle slot that allows you to magnetically clip your iPad into the perfect viewing angle.
* It’s about two-thirds the weight of the iPad, measures only 6.4 mm thick and with the Ultrathin’s high-grade aluminum construction and matching finish, you can hardly tell them apart. Its built-in Bluetooth® keyboard comes complete with iOS® shortcuts and well-spaced keys that make typing fast and fluid.
* And here’s a brief promotional clip for the new case:
* In addition to the updated Ultrathin case, Logitech also announced a handful of other protective cases for Apple’s tablet line, including the Hinge, the Turnaround, and the Big Bang. The first 2 are are multi-angle stands, and the Big Bang is an ultra-rugged case.
* For those interested, the new Ultrathin keyboard case is available for pre-order now on Logitech’s website. The iPad mini/iPad mini with Retina display version will run you $89.99, and the iPad Air model $99.99. And both of them are offered in white and black.
