* So, you’ve been a good boy and are now keeping your fingers crossed that Santa will deliver your brand spanking new 27-inch iMac in time for Christmas? Not so fast. According to the online Apple store, deliveries of Apple’s top-of-the-line iMac model have just been pushed back to as far as January of next year. So, you’re looking at a minimum three-week delay, likely even more.
* It’s not clear whether Apple is facing production difficulties such as low yields or perhaps it underestimated demand for the all-in-one computer, but clearly there will be no 27-incher for you this Christmas. Of course, you could be better served visiting one of Apple’s brick-and-mortar stores or retail outlets of Apple’s authorized distributors who may have a few 27-icnhers in stock…
* Originally, Apple wanted to ship 27-inch iMacs this month.
* For all we know, 27-inchers could now ship at the end of January.
* Jordan Kahn of 9to5Mac reminds us that Apple previously gave a 3-4 week shipping estimate for the 27-inch desktop. As for the 21.5-inch iMac, Apple’s web store in the US and Canada cites a 7-10 business days delivery time.

* Now, this isn’t entirely expected.
* Apple CEO Tim Cook said ahead of the new iMac launch that Apple expected significant delays leading into the holidays. He wasn’t pulling this out of thin air: shortly after the new iMac lineup launch, Apple started pushing back estimated shipping times for both 21.5-inch and 27-inch models.
* After all is said and done, it’s a pity Apple cannot make enough new iMacs for everyone in the run-up to Christmas. I’m guessing they’re facing problems in the supply chain or, worse, some kind of unforeseen issues with the manufacturing.
* The redesigned all-in-one with its dramatically thinner appearance requires new production techniques such as friction-stir welding that contract manufacturers and suppliers might not have fully familiarized themselves with.
* Such demand problems may become a thing of the past if Apple brings some of the iMac manufacturing back to the United States, as Apple’s boss promised.
* As you know, a small portion of iMacs are right now being made in the U.S., apparently at the Freemont, California facility.
* So, were you going to pick up a new iMac this Christmas?
