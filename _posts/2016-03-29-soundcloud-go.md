* SoundCloud, a Berlin, Germany-based global online audio distribution platform, today pushed a major update to its free audio streaming application for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad which includes support for the company’s freshly announced paid subscription music service, dubbed Go.
* Priced at $12.99 per month through Apple’s In-App Purchase mechanism or $9.99 on the web, Go offers SoundCloud listeners an expanded catalog of tracks, as well as new features and new functionality in the app.
* Go is now available in the U.S. via the updated SoundCloud app and on the web.
* With a SoundCloud Go subscription, you can:
* In fact, you can make all of your current and future likes and playlists available for offline listening as well, with liked tracks and playlists becoming available in real time. Any future tracks or playlists you like or create will automatically save, too.
* The new paid service doesn’t spell the end of the road for the free SoundCloud service, which will continue to be available to users around the world, reaching a cool 175 million unique monthly listeners across SoundCloud platforms.
* A free 30-day Go trial is available within the app and on the web, but only for those who haven’t previously subscribed to the service. Your trial must be canceled within 30 days of subscribing or will automatically renew for $12.99 per month if you subscribed through the app, or for $9.99 if you signed up on the SoundCloud website.
* As mentioned, SoundCloud Go is currently available in the United States.
* You can grab SoundCloud’s iOS app free of charge in the App Store.
