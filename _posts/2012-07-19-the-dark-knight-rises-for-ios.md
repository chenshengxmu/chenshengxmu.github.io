* The Dark Knight Rises, the third installment in Nolan’s Batman film series and a sequel to the 2005 Batman Begins and 2008 The Dark Knight, has hit the silver screen with a 87 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, a testament to film director Christopher Nolan’s skills. The movie’s box office success is bound to help Gameloft’s officially licensed title sell well.
* If you’ve been tingling with anticipation, you’ll be delighted to know that The Dark Knight Rises the game has just landed on the App Store and can be downloaded now for your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad…
* The game comes with dozens of missions and random events that task you to deal with hostage situations, bomb squads, jailbreaks and car chases. An elaborate fighting system is also part of the deal, letting you master a bunch of different moves and cinematic effects.
* As is the norm these days, you can also collect items scattered throughout the city to unlock upgrades and new fighting skills. Sadly, release notes don’t mention Retina support, though it may come later by way of a free update.
* Here, a couple iPad screenies.
