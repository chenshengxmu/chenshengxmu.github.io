* Apple has reportedly scored rights to turn “Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change,” an interactive feature that filled an entire recent issue of The New York Times Magazine, into a nonfiction TV show about climate change.
* At least a half-dozen bidders sought to acquire the project.
* The New York Times newspaper reported Tuesday that Apple has confirmed buying TV rights. Jordan Cohen, a spokesman for the paper, said in a prepared statement that “Losing Earth” is “an extremely important piece of journalism and we are thrilled it will get a wider audience.”
* Produced by Anonymous Content, the series will be based on the 30,000-word “Losing Earth” novelistic article by author Nathaniel Rich who will serve as an executive producer on the show with Steve Golin, who is the Oscar-winning founder of “Anonymous”.
* Rich’s story covered the events from 1979 to 1989 when “humanity settled the science of climate change and came surprisingly close to finding a solution”. Produced with the support of the Pulitzer Center, it was based on more than 18 months of reporting and over 100 interviews.
* “The ‘Losing Earth’ article recounted how, from 1979 to 1989, a small group of American scientists, activists and politicians tried to save the world from the ravages of climate change before it was too late,” said the paper.
* “Losing Earth” will be also the subject of an upcoming book, due next year.
* Be sure to check out “Losing Earth” over at the New York Times Magazine.
