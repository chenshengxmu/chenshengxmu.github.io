* A new jailbreak theme package was just released on Cydia, and it allows users who install it to regain the app icons featured in iOS 6 and below. The theme, which is entitled iOS 6 Theme for iOS 7, is a WinterBoard release that replaces the stock iOS 7 app icons with those from earlier firmware. Take a gander at our full video walkthrough inside to see how it looks.
* After installing the iOS 6 Theme from Cydia, you’ll need to venture into the WinterBoard app and enable the iOS 6 theme. Please be aware that if you’re installing WinterBoard for the first time, it will require you to reboot your device. After rebooting, you’ll need to perform the Mobile Substrate reinstall to get the jailbreak tweaks and apps working correctly.
* Once you install and enable the iOS 6 theme, you should notice that virtually all stock app icons now sport the iOS 6 look. There are a few exceptions like Calendar, and Newsstand, but for the most part, your stock icons will look and feel like a blast from the past.
* If you want to give the iOS 6 theme a shot, then head over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo and download it now for free. Be sure to share your thoughts and experiences with the theme in the comment section below.
