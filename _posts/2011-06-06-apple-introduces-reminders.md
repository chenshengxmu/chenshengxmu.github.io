* New features are rolling in for iOS 5. This one is a new application developed directly by Apple, called Reminders. Just like the name suggests, Reminders is a to-do list application.
* Besides letting you add to-dos to your list, Reminders will be location aware, and locations will be able to trigger events. For example, you can have a reminder set to say “remind me to call my wife as soon as I leave the office”…
* “Next time you think to yourself, “Don’t forget to…,” just pull out your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch and jot it down. Reminders lets you organize your life in to-do lists — complete with due dates and locations. Say you need to remember to pick up milk during your next grocery trip. Since Reminders can be location based, you’ll get an alert as soon as you pull into the supermarket parking lot. Reminders also works with iCal, Outlook, and iCloud, so changes you make update automatically on all your devices and calendars.”
* This looks similar to the patent we talked about last week. We don’t have much info about Reminders for the time being, but we’ll make sure to give you updates as more info come in.
