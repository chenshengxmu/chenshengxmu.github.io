* In an earlier tutorial, we showed you how to create a new partition on Mac. But what if, after testing, you wish to delete the partition and relinquish its space? In this video tutorial, we’ll show you how easy it is to dissolve a partition using macOS’ built-in Disk Utility.
* Step 1: Open Disk Utility.
* Step 2: Click the partition that you wish to delete under the logical volume.
* Step 3: Click the Erase tab and make sure Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) is selected.
* Step 4: Click the Erase button.
* Step 5: Click the logical volume.
* Step 6: Click the Partition tab.
* Step 7: Highlight the partition that you erased in step 4.
* Step 8: Click the ‘-‘ sign and click Remove.
* Step 9: Use the drag handle to reallocate the space back relinquished by the deleted partition.
* Step 10: Click Apply → Partition.
* After a few seconds, all of the space taken from the purged partition will be reallocated. After it completes, you can close Disk Utility.
* Be sure to watch the video embedded above in the event that you’re unclear about any particular step mentioned. It’s a fairly straightforward process, but it still helps to see an example.
* What do you think about macOS’ built-in Disk Utility and its functions? Do you find it easy to use? Sound off down below in the comments with your thoughts.
