* I’m a big fan of the ingenious CloudMagic Search, a free iPhone app that acts as a unified search box for my online services and social media accounts such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Dropbox, Box, Evernote, SkyDrive, Twitter and many more. Having seeing a couple hundred-thousand downloads, the Palo Alto-based CloudMagic Inc. felt encouraged to apply its cloud search expertise to a lightweight email client.
* Meet CloudMagiC Mail, a new iOS email app featuring “fast magical search” that supports a bunch of popular email accounts like Gmail, Exchange, Yahoo, Outlook, Google Apps, Office 365, IMAP and even Apple’s iCloud…
* Fans of Google-owned Sparrow or Dropbox-owned Mailbox should feel right at home in CloudMagic Mail. The program features a minimalist user interface and is heavy on gestures so you can swipe over individual messages to delete, file into folders or access additional actions.

* As we all organize our emails largely to find the right message at the right time, the apps’ main focus is making cross-service search as reliable, speedy and accurate as possible. As the screenies top of post illustrate, CloudMagic Mail does indeed support a plethora of email services so chances are yours is on the list unless you depend on some really obscure email service.

* From what I’ve experienced, search in CloudMagic Mail is awesome.
* You can search across all your mailboxes in one go and it’s really fast – the app produces results almost instantaneously, which doesn’t surprise me given they’ve built it on the previously mentioned CloudMagic Search’s proven engine.
* I’ll let the promo vid do the talking.
* Other features I’m liking: smart search suggestions, unified inbox for all your accounts, complete support for Microsoft Exchange (2003, 2007, 2010, 2013, including ActiveSync, EWS and IMAP), push notifications, offline mode, the ability to set reminders to follow up on starred emails, passcode lock protection, threaded conversation view and move to folders/labels.
* That’s more useful stuff right off the bat than in either Mailbox or Sparrow.
* CloudMagic is available free from the App Store.
* The universal binary weighs in only 6.2MB and supports natively iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices running iOS 6 or later.
* The free edition is limited to a total of three email accounts and doesn’t let you set a passcode. A Pro upgrade which removes restrictions is available as an in-app purchase.
* Deal breaker: going Pro will set you back an absurdly ridiculous $49.99.
