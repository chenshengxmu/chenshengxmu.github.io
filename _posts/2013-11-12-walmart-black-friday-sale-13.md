* And they’re off! With Black Friday now just a few weeks away, retailers have begun teasing their after-Thanksgiving-day sales in hopes of convincing hordes of customers to visit their stores on the busiest shopping weekend of the year.
* We’ve already seen a preview of Target’s sale, which offers the 16GB Wi-Fi iPad Air for $479 with a free $100 gift card, and other discounts. And now, Walmart has published a snippet of its Black Friday specials showing a similar offer…
* Throughout the 42-page ad you’ll find a number of discounts on things like TVs, Blu-Ray players, laptops, and yes—iPads. Walmart says that while supplies last, it will give a $100 gift card to anyone who purchases a $299 iPad mini.

* Additionally, the retailer will be selling the iPhone 5c for $45 and the iPhone 5s for $189 (with 2-year contract), and it’ll include free $75 gift cards for each. It will also be offering up to $300 of in-store credit for your old smartphone.
* Keep in mind that a number of other retailers will be hosting Black Friday sales, including Apple. So it’s worth shopping around. But I will say that, in my experience, Walmart offers some of the best deals around if you get there early.
* Prices listed are good from November 28 to December 1 unless otherwise noted. To view the full 42-page ad, click here.
