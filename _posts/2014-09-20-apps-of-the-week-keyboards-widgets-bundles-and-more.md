* Oh boy, oh boy. For me, the best part about a big update to Apple’s mobile operating system is the super cool updates and new apps that make use of new features. This weekend is going to be fun for me. If you are excited about the new features in iOS 8 that you’ll be able to take advantage of, or just want something fun to pass the time with, we’ve got a list of apps and games we think you’ll enjoy.

* With the launch of iOS 8 finally arriving, developers are updating their apps and introducing new ones that take advantage of the many new features. Several keyboards that have been around for a while, as well as some new ones, can now replace your default iOS keyboard forever. Check out our list of keyboards for iOS 8.

* Many popular apps are being updated to support Notification Center widgets in the Today view for displaying information and performing actions without having to open the app. We’ve compiled an extensive list of apps that support iOS 8′s new Notification Center APIs and are available to download and install on iOS 8. This is a selection of Notification Center widgets.

* We’ve been busy gathering a collection of apps that have introduced support for the new Touch ID API alongside the launch of iOS 8. Have a look at it.

* You may have noticed over the past 24 hours that a new section has appeared in the App Store entitled “Apps & Games for iPhone 6.” As you’d expect, the section is meant to highlight apps and games that have been updated for the larger displays on the two new iPhones. Take a look at this new section.

* Alongside iOS 8, the App Store received a number of improvements, including video previews and support for app bundles. And with yesterday’s release, several app bundles popped up in Apple’s digital storefront, so we’ve decided to roundup a few worth checking out. Have a look at our selection of bundles.

* In the wake of iOS 8 there sure are a lot of awesome new features. One of them being that you can now use TextExpander on your iPhone and iPad. You can create custom shortcuts for words, and even sentences. Create advanced snippets that fill in blank form letters. If you’ve already been using TextExpander for Mac, you can use Dropbox to sync your customizations between desktop and iOS. This app is available for $4.99.

* As if I haven’t had more than my fill of block sliding game, here comes another fun and colorful submission to the puzzle genre. This game is sort of the reverse of Tetris. Players slide colorful blocks around on a grid, trying to create a particular shape that is listed at the top of the screen. When you make the right pattern, you’ll earn points. The more shapes you successfully create in a row, the higher your score gets. Players also pick up special gifts that include such things as lasers and bombs. Use these items to clear the screen. This game is available for $1.99.

* Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a goat? You can eat whatever you like, poop wherever you want, and headbutt that idiot down the street, or a car, or a house. A goat’s head is pretty tough. This game has been around for quite a while now and it is truly hilarious. There is no real goal. It is just a whole lot of crashing into things with epic ragdoll graphic results. The game is intentionally awkward with funny glitches and skipping animations. And, you can be a goat. This game is available for $4.99.

* Do you remember when Epic Games showed off a demonstration of what the Metal API was capable of? Well, now you can fiddle about with that awesome looking app. You can zoom out to view a lush floating world, tap the cherry blossom to produce leaves and then make the wind blow them away. Tap the Kio pond to attract dozens of fish and make them follow your finger. In the Zen garden, rake geometric art into the pebble landscape. You can even sit back and listen to the sound of water flowing near the tranquil fountain. This app is available for free.

* This cartoon puzzle game uses light and color to trigger doors, traps, and other dungeon obstacles. Make the yellow baby totem move using yellow light. Make the green one move using green light. Change the color of the lights by positioning the parent totem in front of the illumination. Light also powers the mechanics in the secret chambers of the tombs. Use mirrors to bend the light and trigger a cog that will turn a wheel and open a door. Watch out for mummies. If they are awakened by the light, they will chase after your baby totems. This game is available for $1.99.

* Adventure Time… dooby-dooby-doo. Can’t get enough. Don’t have to with this funny puzzle labyrinth starring Jake, as far as he can stretch, and Finn ridin’ his back like a boss. The more Jake eats, the longer he grows. Finn is there for fighting support. Slash the bad guys so Jake can stretch even further. This game is a twist on the iconic Snake game that was so famous in 400 million Nokia phones during the late 1990s and on. The goal is to collect all of the treasure because, you know, adventures and stuff. This game is available for $2.99.

* Another awesome feature now available in iOS 8 is the ability to add widgets to Notification Center. Instead of only seeing your Calendar and Mail, you can check out posts from the New York Times, keep track of your to-do list, and get more details than you ever imagined on the weather, all without even unlocking your iPhone. This widget will let you know the current temperature and conditions, humidity levels, and a five-day forecast for your designated city. This widget thing is going to be big. I can already tell. This app is available for $0.99.
