* Apple yesterday refreshed its Investor Relations webpage to inform investors that it will be holding its 2018 annual shareholders meeting at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park on Monday, February 13 of next year.
* This will be Apple’s second event at the Steve Jobs Theater following the iPhone 8 and iPhone X introduction back in September. The company previously said it planned to use the venue for both press presentations and corporate events and meetings.
* Advance registration is required for the event due to limited seating at the Steve Jobs Theater.
* “We anticipate there may be more shareholders who would like to attend than we have seats to accommodate,” notes the company. “Therefore, if you’re a shareholder as of December 15, 2017 and you’d like to attend the meeting, you will need to register in advance.”
* Additional details about the meeting will be available soon after Apple files its proxy statement. Once the proxy statement is filed, organizations that hold Apple shares will be issuing proxy materials to investors that will include a unique control number needed.
* Shareholders will use that number to register for the meeting on a first-come, first-served basis at proxyvote.com beginning at 8:00am PT on January 22, 2018. To quality for the meeting, investors must have held shares of Apple as of December 15, 2017.
* The Cupertino giant recently asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to block shareholder proposals involving issues like greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and human rights given its existing focus on those issues.
