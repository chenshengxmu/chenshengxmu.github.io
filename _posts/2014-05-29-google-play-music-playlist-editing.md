* Google’s iOS client for its Play Music service has received a little update today bringing a few useful enhancement to make the experience better and less frictionless. For starters, the new Google Play Music version 1.2.1.1787 has removed a major annoyance: you can now finally edit playlists on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Needless to say, any changes made to a playlist on one device instantly reflect on all your others.
* And when sorting through your cloud music library, the app now makes it dead simple to filter only the tracks that you’ve downloaded to your device for offline listening. There are two other additions, explained after the break.
* Google Play Music is free in the App Store…
* You’ll also notice a new scrollable app header and an Artist Shuffle feature which, like the name suggests, shuffles through songs from the same artist rather than through your whole music library.
* I’ve also noticed that the app icon recently changed from this…

* Not a major change, but nice as it makes the icon stand out more on your Home screen and more in line with the app’s color styling.

* Here’s the full changelog:
* • Greatly improved download experience with ‘Downloaded Only’ filter • Added ability to edit a playlist • Added Shuffle Artist feature • Improved UI with new scrollable app header
* A native iPad interface has been discovered recently in the iPhone build so here’s hoping that Google Play Music becomes universal real soon.
* The app received its iOS 7 styling last December.
* If you regularly upload your own tracks to Google Music, check out a time-saving Chrome Labs feature which makes the process as easy as dragging song files from a folder on your Mac and dropping them onto the Chrome browser.
* Download Google Play Music free in the App Store.
* iOS 6.0 or later is required.
