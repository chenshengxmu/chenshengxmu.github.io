* Snapchat recently rolled out a minor refresh to its iPhone application in the App Store, bumping version number to 9.39.3.0 and bringing out a new Sticker Search feature. As the feature’s name suggests, this lets you find precisely the sticker you want simply by typing its description. A previous Snapchat update introduced a few tweaks, including support for caption styling with the new bold, underline and italic options.
* To use Sticker Search, tap a newly added search bar the next time you add stickers to a Snap. To use Sticker Search while chatting, type something into the chat field then hit the smiley button to find appropriate stickers.
* Grab Snapchat for free on the App Store.
