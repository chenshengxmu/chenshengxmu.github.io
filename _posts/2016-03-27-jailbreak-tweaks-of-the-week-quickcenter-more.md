* It was a busy week for Apple; after releasing updates for all of its platforms and even unveiling the new iPhone SE and 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the company now has numerous new features in its operating systems and even more devices to choose from.
* For the jailbreak community, the week has been pretty still, but nevertheless, the week did come with some Cydia gems that we’re going to cover in this roundup. As usual, we’ll start first with our favorites, and then go down the list with the rest of the jailbreak tweak releases that came out this week.
* QuickCenter is a wonderful release that brings 3D Touch-oriented features to Control Center. But don’t fret if you don’t have a 3D Touch-capable device, because the tweak will work on non-3D Touch devices by way of tap and hold gestures, just like 3D Touch jailbreak tweaks should!
* With this tweak, you’ll be able to use gestures on each of the toggle buttons and app shortcuts within Control Center to access Quick Actions related to those features. For example, doing the gesture on the Wi-Fi toggle lets you switch between networks, and doing the gesture on the Camera shortcut brings up a camera view finder, etc.
* You can configure various options for this tweak for your user preference, as well as for your security, but to learn more about how the tweak works in depth, you should really look at our full review where you’ll find more information.
* CKCounter: Keeps count of all the messages in each of your texting conversations (free – review)
* InvertRespring: Inverts the respring and reboot screen colors (free – review)
* Despite iOS 9.3 being the latest firmware for your iOS devices to date, there is still no jailbreak out to the public for any firmware later than iOS 9.1. We recommend remaining patient, as we’re sure jailbreak teams are working hard to find some sort of solution for jailbreakers before Apple makes the next major iOS announcement this Summer.
* Those of you already rocking a jailbreak that are looking for more can look back at last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup.
* What were your favorite jailbreak tweak releases this week? Share in the comments!
