* Apple’s TrueDepth camera on iPhone X uses infrared sensors that capture light in the wavelength range of 800nm to 1300nm to achieve pattern-based depth mapping, allowing it to work day or night, like devices used for medical diagnosis, food inspection and night vision.
* The company has now been granted an important patent that covers advanced near-infrared imaging optics and high-resolution imaging lenses used in the TrueDepth camera.
* The United States Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday published Apple’s latest granted patent titled “Near-infrared imaging lens,” which is based on the company’s earlier patent filing in Taiwan covering near-infrared imaging devices.

* From the patent abstract, here are the optical elements that the TrueDepth camera’s infrared imaging component uses, arranged in order from the object side to the image side.
* The four specialized lenses work together in the near-infrared wavelength to capture an object along with its depth map onto an image plane. The optical elements are configured to form an infrared image at a F/2.0 aperture with a diagonal full field of view greater than 80 degrees.
* The predefined maximum angle is no greater than 45 degrees.
* First filed for in the first quarter of 2016, the granted patent cites Apple engineers Miodran Scepanovic, Yoshikazu Shinohara and Yuhong Yao as its inventors.
