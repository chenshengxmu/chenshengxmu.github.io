* The popular SemiTether jailbreak was updated to v0.9.1 this morning, and it’s quite the update.
* Working with Saurik, the team was able to fully incorporate the new mobile substrate, which allowed them to get rid of the daemon patching and restarting.
* Mobile substrate now does all of the heavy lifting when it comes to the SemiTether. There’s even an option to patch Safari to work in non-jailbreak mode now.
* Perhaps most importantly, the new version of SemiTether will protect your iOS 5 Notification Center plugins…
* Along with that much needed feature, the team also says that they are looking into patching Mail, and working with the developers of MyWi and AppSync.
* Per BigBoss here are is the summary of changes:
* 1) Much more stable with new mobile substrate 2) Can patch safari so it works in the non-jailbreak reboot mode 3) App to monitor the status of your semitether and reapply. Check after Cydia installs.
* The team states that this update will certainly address the “flakiness” of the previous versions of SemiTether, but to keep in mind that this is still a beta package, and a complete rewrite of mobile substrate.
* If you haven’t seen the video that we created that shows how to SemiTether jailbreak your device, then check it out below:
