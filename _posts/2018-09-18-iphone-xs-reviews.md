* The early iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max reviews are now being posted online. Not surprisingly, most focus on the subtle differences between the two handsets and the 2017 iPhone X. Each reviewer also suggests would-buyers should wait until the iPhone XR is released next month before making a purchasing decision.
* Here are excerpts from some of the first iPhone XS/XS Max reviews:
* The Verge‘s Nilay Patel explains that “both iPhone XS models are fundamentally just spec-bumped updates to the iPhone X.” He suggests no one with the 2017 handset needs to upgrade, “but if you’re already deep into a preorder, don’t worry: you will love the iPhone XS.”
* For everyone else, he explains that “it’s worth waiting to see how the iPhone XR turns out before rushing in — it has the same processor and the same main camera for $750. The only major question is how good its 6.1-inch LCD will look in comparison to the OLED on the XS.”

* The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern had similar thoughts. Though she was impressed with both the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, she suggests waiting until the iPhone XR launches in October to make a decision.
* Imagine Goldilocks only tested the cold and hot porridges and never found the one that was “just right.” Her life might have been entirely different. That’s how I feel about testing the iPhone XS and XS Max—without the iPhone XR—for the past week.
* TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino says some might not be happy with this year’s “S” models because they aren’t all that different than the iPhone X. Still, he says that “weakness, however, is only really present if you view it through the eyes of the year-over-year upgrader.” He suggests those iPhone X users will only be happy if you “love what they’ve done with the camera to want to make the jump.”
* Nonetheless, “As a move from any other device, it’s a huge win.”

* Finally, there’s Mashable’s Raymond Wong who actually goes in a different direction. He believes both models offer much more than subtle changes — if you look inside the devices.
* He explains:
* The time has come for us to look beyond the surface of the iPhone — they’re all gonna look like the iPhone X from here on out. Maybe the notch and the bezels shrink over the next couple of years, but the real game-changing innovations are all happening inside. So start paying more attention to them, because they’re “boring” but will increasingly matter more.
* As someone who purchased an iPhone XS Max to replace my iPhone X, I don’t have a beef with anything that was said in these reviews. Nonetheless, I also agree that for the average iPhone owners, it’s a wise choice to wait until the iPhone XR arrives on Oct. 26 to decide which one is best.
* As a reminder, you can pre-order the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max now. Both models officially launch in stores this Friday, Sept. 21. Pre-orders for the iPhone XR will be accepted beginning on Friday, Oct. 19.
