* Good news for folks who use Day One this morning. The popular journal app has been updated with a new iOS 7 design and several new features, including support for Apple’s new 64-bit A7 processor.
* Additionally, the update, which brings the app to version 1.12, includes support for the new M7 coprocessor. And this allows the app to do things like count your steps and auto-track your daily activities…
* Here is the full change log for version 1.12:
* – New iOS 7 Design – Automated activity data tracking for iPhone 5s – Daily Step Counting (M7 coprocessor required) – Speed improvements and optimizations – Additional weather source: forecast.io – Add currently playing music track info to entry – Fix issues with iPhone 5s panoramas – 64-bit
* As far as the new design goes, if you’ve been digging other big-name app iOS 7 redesigns, you’ll love it. It has the usual large white spaces, flat text and simplified icons that we’ve seen in other iOS 7 updates.

* And as for the new features, I haven’t been able to test the daily step counter, but the ability to add info from the song you’re currently listening to is a nice touch. It looks like this is for Music app only though.
* If you haven’t tried it yet, and have been looking for a journal app, I recommend checking Day One out. It has a 5-star rating on both mobile and Mac, and you can find the app in the App Store for $4.99.
