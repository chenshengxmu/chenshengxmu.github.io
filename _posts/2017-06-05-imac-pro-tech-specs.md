* Apple discontinued the Mac Pro to work on a completely new kind of all-in-one computer that has comparable specs. They’re going ahead and calling it the iMac Pro, and behind that super sexy space gray finish is a ton of computing power that appeals to professionals who need the extra processing power.
* In this piece, we’ll talk about the tech specs of the iMac Pro, which was just announced by Apple at WWDC 2017.
* That wraps things up for the new iMac Pro, and while the specs list isn’t quite that detailed just yet, you can expect more CPU information to surface as soon as the machine is officially available for sale in December.
* While it will likely be out of the price range of most everyday folk, it definitely packs a lot more punch than any iMac or Mac Pro the pre-dates it and will leave computer geeks drooling when they lay eyes upon it.
* Are you impressed with the hardware that comes in the iMac Pro, and will you be getting one? Share in the comments below!
