* Today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday in the United States.
* In honor of the holiday, which commemorates Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday, Apple has devoted its homepage to a full-page black and white photo of the famous civil rights movement leader and a quote: “The time is always right to do what is right.”
* Apple CEO Tim Cook joined the celebration by sharing a quote from Dr. King on Twitter: “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”
* “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” Let’s find the light and the love, together. #MLK

* “Let’s find the light and the love, together,” Cook added.
* Apple in the past published similar commemorations on its homepage to celebrate prior Martin Luther King Jr. Days. The civil rights leader was famously featured during Apple’s award-winning “Think Different” advertising campaign.
* A Steve Jobs-narrated video of that ad is embedded above for your viewing pleasure.
