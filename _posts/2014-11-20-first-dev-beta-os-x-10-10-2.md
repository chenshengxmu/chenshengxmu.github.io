* Apple has seeded the first beta of OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 this afternoon. The update, labeled build 14C68k, is available through the Update tab in the Mac App Store and the Dev Center for all registered Mac developers.
* Today’s release comes just a few days after Apple officially launched 10.10.1 to the public, which featured bug fixes and Wi-Fi improvements—although some users are still complaining of Wi-Fi issues after updating.

* We’re not sure yet what changes 10.10.2 brings, but there are still a number of bugs that need fixing. We’re installing the beta now, and will note major changes. If you find something, e-mail us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
