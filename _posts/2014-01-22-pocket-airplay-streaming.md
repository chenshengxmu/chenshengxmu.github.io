* Users of the popular read-later application Pocket (formerly Read It Later) are saving more than two million videos each week and now you can enjoy all those clips on your big screen TV thanks to newly-implemented support for AirPlay background video streaming in Pocket 5.0.2.
* Now available free in the App Store, Pocket 5.0.2 also fixes an issue with sharing links to Facebook and another one pertaining to the Pocket bookmarklet, which should now work correctly when installed in Google’s Chrome browser…
* AirPlay support has been improved in Pocket 5.0.2 to allow continuous playback when Pocket is closed or your device goes to sleep. This is quite handy and I wish more apps supported background AirPlay streaming.
* It makes it a pleasure to watch my previously saved videos on a big screen through the $99 Apple TV hockey puck without having to keep Pocket open. The last thing you want is for your Pocket video to stop streaming when your iPhone or iPad automatically goes to sleep.
* According to Pocket, AirPlay multitasking is supported as well.
* What’s that?
* Easy, this lets you AirPlay a video from Pocket, then exit Pocket and fire up another app like Mail or Safari while the clip continues to play through Apple’s media-streaming box.
* If you’re looking for some video inspiration, follow @PocketHits.
* Grab Pocket 5.0.2 free of charge in the App Store.
* The universal iPhone/iPad download comes in at 22.2MB and requires iOS 6.0 or later.
