* I’m not sure what i0n1c is better at: security research, or trolling?
* In typical i0n1c manner, talented German researcher Stefan Esser has published a video demonstrating a jailbroken iPhone 5c running iOS 7.1.1. This is the same iPhone 5c that he showed off a few days ago in a photo shared online, but this time, we obviously get to see much more about what i0n1c calls the Cyberelevat0r jailbreak…
* Although we had no doubt about the veracity of i0n1c’s claims, the video confirms that the device is indeed running iOS 7.1.1 and that he was able to successfully install Cydia as well as a couple jailbreak utilities. To avoid all confusion, i0n1c also goes through the reboot process to prove that this is an untethered jailbreak.
* While there is absolutely no doubt that i0n1c is a skilled hacker, it’s hard not to feel like he is also an attention-seeking troll. The situation actually reminds me of the daycare where I drop off my daughter every day. There is this one kid that always comes over with new toys and flashes them in the face of all the other kids. Of course, all the kids want to play with the toys but he won’t let them even get close to the toys. When that happens, the woman in charge of the daycare usually tells the kid that it is his right not to share his own toy, but it is not nice to tease others. These are basic social skills that we teach our kids in daycare…
* It is clear that he will not release the jailbreak to the public, so why throw oil on the fire by constantly reminding people that they can’t get what they see? Like the daycare woman, I believe that i0n1c can do whatever he wants with his jailbreak, but I also believe there is no need to tease over and over again if you’re not going to share.
* Of course, I can’t help but feel like we’re part of the problem too when we publicize i0n1c’s trolling exploits, which in itself is a whole different story.
