* Instagram recently added a tool that permits you to save posts for later and organize them into Pinterest-like curated collections that only you can see. Whether you want to plan your next day trip, revisit your favorite artists’ illustrations or always have some animal videos on hand, our tutorial will get you up to speed on Instagram’s Saved Posts and Collections features and lay out the basics of keeping track of any posts you wish to remember.
* To save any post you see on Instagram, tap the Bookmark icon underneath the post.

* It’s nice that when you bookmark someone’s post they’re not able to tell that you’ve saved it.
* Saving a post simply creates a bookmark rather that store the actual post on your device. If the person whose post you have saved later deletes it from their Instagram account, it will disappear from your saved posts, too.
* All saved posts are visible to you from a private section of your profile.
