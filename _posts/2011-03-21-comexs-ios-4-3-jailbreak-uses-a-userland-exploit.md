* Last week we reported about Comex being the first to jailbreak iOS 4.3 on the iPad 2. Today we find out a bit more information about this iOS 4.3 jailbreak. In a reply to a tweet asking him what kind of exploit Comex had found in iOS 4.3, he said that he uses a userland exploit, meaning the jailbreak might be applied directly from the device, a la JailbreakMe.
* Because a userland jailbreak can easily be patched via a software update, and with the rumors of iOS 4.3.1 coming in the next couple weeks, I doubt we will see Comex’s jailbreak before then…
* In his tweet, Comex also refers to a bootrom exploit, which probably is i0n1c’s jailbreak we talked about a couple weeks ago. Because this type of jailbreak can only be patched via a hardware upgrade, the jailbreak community might want to save this exploit for after the iPhone 5 comes out.
* Since he revealed he had successfully jailbroken an iPad 2 on iOS 4.3, we didn’t get much more information about the jailbreak. I assume this userland exploit would work with any device on iOS 4.3, but this has yet to be confirmed.
* More to come as the news unfold.
