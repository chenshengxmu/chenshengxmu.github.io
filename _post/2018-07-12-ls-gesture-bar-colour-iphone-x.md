* While the notch is one of the iPhone X’s most distinguishable features, so too is the missing Home button, which has been replaced with a new gesture bar.
* Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t provide any customization options for said gesture bar, but a new free jailbreak tweak called LS Gesture Bar Colour (iPhone X) by iOS developer Justin Petkovic provides you with the customization that you might be looking for.
* Just as the name implies, LS Gesture Bar Colour (iPhone X) lets you change the color of the iPhone X’s gesture bar. In the screenshots above, you can see a few examples of the tweak in action.
* LS Gesture Bar Colour (iPhone X) adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can set the tweak up:

* Here, you can:
* Notably, the color cell opens a color picker rather than a list of pre-defined colors. This means you can find every major color and everything in between, which provides seemingly-infinite options.
* The developer also includes a convenient respring button in the preference pane so that you can save your changes every time you change the color or toggle the tweak on or off.
* While it seems like a trivial means of customizing the iPhone X, it’s amazing what such a small modification can do to personalize your device. If you’d like to give it a try for yourself, then you can download it for free from Cydia’s Packix repository.
* LS Gesture Bar Colour (iPhone X) is made to work on jailbroken iPhone X handsets only, and consequently, requires iOS 11.
