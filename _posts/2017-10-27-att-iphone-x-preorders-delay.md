* Some unfortunate customers saw unexpected delays of ten to fifteen minutes or longer when they scrambled to preorder their iPhone X as soon as preorders went live early Friday morning.
* Some of the affected users took to Twitter to share their disappointment with the delays. One customer who used AT&T’s mobile app to preorder an iPhone X was greeted with a 16-minute wait time, with the delay causing them to repeatedly lose their position in the queue.
* MacRumors relays stories from other folks who saw Apple’s online store and the Apple Store app remain offline for up to twenty minutes after iPhone X preorders kicked off.
* @ATT guess I’m not getting an iPhone X because ATT keeps cycling me through and losing my place in line. pic.twitter.com/trrHp5IWLk

* Some people were told by Apple via email that the firm couldn’t reach the carrier systems, instructing them to complete their order for delivery as early as November 3.
* AppleInsider notes that some unfortunate buyers saw their credit freeze put in place following the Equifax data breach that held up authorization of payment plan loans.
* We haven’t noticed any delays ourselves, unless you count our own Andrew O’Hara who was initially forced to wait a little longer until his business rep got his order in.
* Thx for nothing @CitizensOne for using @Equifax to check my credit. No iPhone X for me. @Equifax breach…the gift that keeps on giving.

* iPhone X lead times are currently 5-6 weeks in the United States.
* Based on historical iPhone lead times and iPhone X preorder lead times in the United States, Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster predicted that iPhone X supply will probably meet global demand 3-4 months after launch, or some time in the March 2018 quarter.
* Have you experienced any delays when you were trying to preorder your iPhone X?
