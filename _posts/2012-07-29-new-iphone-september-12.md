* Thanks to leaked components and industry sources, it feels like we know just about everything there is to know about Apple’s new smartphone. We [think we] know what it looks like, and what new features it will have. But we haven’t heard much about its release date, until now.
* A new report is out this evening claiming that Apple is planning to unveil the sixth-generation iPhone at a “special event” on Wednesday, September 12, and it’s expected to release the handset the following week. But that’s not all the Cupertino company has in store…
* Rene Ritchie of iMore reports:
* “iMore has heard that Apple is planning to debut the new iPhone at a special event on Wednesday, September 12, 2012, with the release date to follow 9 days later on Friday, September 21. This information comes from sources who have proven accurate in the past.
* The iPad mini will be announced at the same September 12 event, as will the new iPod nano. We haven’t heard a release date for the iPad mini yet, but it could be the same as the iPhone 5. It seems likely the new iPod touch will make an appearance on September 12 as well, though we haven’t heard any specific information about that yet either.”
* Ritchie’s sources have been extremely accurate as of late. If you recall, iMore correctly predicted the day and date of this year’s iPad event, and it kickstarted the ‘smaller dock connector’ theory all the way back in February.
* And this isn’t the first time we’ve heard September 21st mentioned as a possible release date for the new iPhone. Last week, a report from App4phone said that its Chinese manufacturing sources named the day as well.
* While we were expecting an October launch date, in line with last year’s release, iMore’s recent track record combined with reports that new iPhone production is already under way, make a late September timeframe feasible.
* On that note, this is certainly shaping up to be an interesting event. With an all-new iPhone, a smaller iPad, a new iPod nano and possibly Touch all on the menu, it seems like Apple is gearing up for a serious holiday quarter.
* Who’s excited?
