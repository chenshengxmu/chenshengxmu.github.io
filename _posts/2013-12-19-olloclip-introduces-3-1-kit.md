* Olloclip, the makers of the widely popular clip-on iPhone lens kits, has announced a new accessory just in time for the holidays. It’s a 3-in-1 photo lens made specifically for Apple’s just-released iPhone 5c handset.
* The new kit features familiar attachments—a macro lens, a fisheye lens and a wide-angle lens—and comes in the 5 colors of the iPhone 5c. And, like its 5/5s counterpart, it’s made of very high quality materials…
* The olloclip uses precision-ground glass for its lenses, and the barrels are made from aircraft-grade aluminum. The iPhone attachment is made from a soft plastic material that ensures you get a secure fit every time.

* Here’s a breakdown of the 3 lenses:
* The Macro lens applies roughly a 10X multiplier and allows you to focus the iPhone within 12-15mm of the subject. The Macro lens is cleverly concealed within the olloclip and can be accessed by unscrewing the Wide-Angle lens that is normally attached to it.
* The Fisheye lens captures approximately a 180 Degree field-of-view and produces some striking images.
* The Wide-Angle lens is great for when you need that extra field of view, approximately double that of the normal iPhone. 
* There’s a lot of these clip-on lens kits for iPhone available these days, but this is still one of the most recognized in the space. So if you’re looking for a kit as a gift for someone, or yourself, you can’t go wrong with olloclip.
* If you’re interested, you can find this new iPhone 5c 3-in-1 lens kit in the olloclip store for $59.99. It comes in blue, green, pink, white, and yellow, and unfortunately, won’t start shipping until sometime in early January.
