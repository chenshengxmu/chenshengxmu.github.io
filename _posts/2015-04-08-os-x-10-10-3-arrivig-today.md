* Get your Macs ready for a major software refresh as Apple gears up to release the OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 software update with the long-awaited Photos for Mac app and other improvements.
* Associated Press, which ran a review of Photos for Mac earlier this morning and first reported that the software update is due today, praised the software’s professional-level and advanced fine-tuning tools such as granular color correction.
* “Apple’s new Photos app for Mac computers, available Wednesday as a free software update, makes it easy to organize and edit your pictures,” the news organization wrote.
* “Like other free apps such as Google’s Picasa, Photos is good for auto-enhancing, cropping and other basic touches such as lightening underexposed shots,” reporter Anick Jesdanun wrote. “But it goes further by also including some of the advanced fine-tuning you’d find in a tool like Adobe Lightroom, which costs $149.”
* With Photo for Mac, users at last can enjoy a unified, streamlined photo-management solution across their Mac, iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices.

* The app can be optionally used in conjunction with iCloud Photo Library, a feature that stores entire photo libraries in the cloud in full resolution in order to save storage space on your devices. Any changes made to a photo on one device instantly reflect on all your others via iCloud Photo Library.
* Photos for Mac lets you import content from iPhoto, the app it replaces as the default photo-management solution on Macs. You can import photographs from other sources, including those in cameras’ proprietary RAW formats.
* Deleting a photo or video automatically removes it from both the cloud and all your synced devices, but you have about a month to retrieve it from the cloud should you change your mind.

* However, Apple only gives five gigabytes of cloud storage for free, hardly enough to store even a modest library of high-resolution photographs and videos in the cloud.
* The company offers storage upgrades but at a higher price than Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and others, though none of competing solutions are as tightly integrated with the Apple platform as iCloud Photo Library is.
* For example, for 99 cents per month your iCloud storage will be expanded to twenty gigabytes of cloud-storage space. The 200GB/500GB/1TB tiers are priced at $3.99/$9.99/$19.99 per month.
* Are you excited about OS X 10.10.3 and the Photos app?
