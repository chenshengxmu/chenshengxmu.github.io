* Google’s YouTube updated its iOS client today, bringing the app to version 10.28. The update brings about two major enhancements: support for fullscreen playback of vertical videos and push notifications.
* The former is fairly significant. Users can now view vertically-filmed videos in fullscreen when in portrait mode—a big improvement over previous versions, which would shrink content between two black bars.
* The latter item is also a big deal. With YouTube 10.28, users can ask to be notified when new videos are posted to their favorite channels. Once enabled, the app will send a notification when it detects new content.
* You can find the latest version of YouTube, for both iPhone and iPad, in the App Store for free.
