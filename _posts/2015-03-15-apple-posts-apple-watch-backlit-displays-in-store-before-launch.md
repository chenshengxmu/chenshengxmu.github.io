* Apple Stores across the globe have posted backlit displays showing off the new Apple Watch and 12-inch MacBook, ahead of the devices’ launch next month.
* The new graphics are in typical Apple fashion, showing large images of the products and their detail for customers to see. As you can imagine, Apple has posted these images to get customers’ minds wandering about the new Apple products, hoping it prompts purchases in less than a month.
