* As promised, the new Facebook version 6.0 update has just dropped on the App Store, bringing out a number of new features such as Chat Heads borrowed from Facebook Home for Android, a redesigned user interface on the iPad focused on the new News Feed which was announced in March, stickers in chat windows and more.
* Get downloading and read the following one-line disclaimer from Facebook before you jump straight to the comments:
* “Chat Heads and stickers will be available to everyone over the next few weeks”.
* There, it’s a staggered roll-out, you’ve been warned…
* Check out the new Chat Heads and chat stickers on a pair of screenies top of post.
* Now you can keep chatting even when you’re doing other stuff on Facebook, like checking your News Feed.
* To reply to a message, just tap Chat Heads. You can drag them around or flick them down to close.
* To add stickers to your messages, just tap the smiley icon. Some stickers are free and others can be purchased in the Sticker Store revealed upon tapping the basket icon.
* This is the new News Feed layout on an iPhone.

* At least it no longer looks like a blown-up iPhone interface, no?
* “The biggest change is on iPad, where you’ll see brighter, more beautiful stories,” reads a media release.
* Indeed, you can now browse your News Feed by Music, Photos, Games and other categories.
* Chat Heads tell me 2 things: overlays suck, & we really need a way to do this that’s part of the sys UI and not an overlay. Second screen?
