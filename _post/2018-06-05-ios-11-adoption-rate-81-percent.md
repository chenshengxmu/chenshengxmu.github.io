* iOS 11 is now installed on 81% of Apple’s over a billion active iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices in the wild, up from the 76% adoption rate reported on April 25. By contrast, Android Oreo versions powered less than six percent of active Android-driven smartphones and tablets that had been accessing Google’s Play Store during a seven-day period ending on May 7, 2018.
* iOS 10 still powers 14% of active devices and older editions are running on five percent of iPhones, iPads and iPods. Apple’s latest adoption rate stats were shared yesterday by software engineering chief Craig Federighi during the WWDC 2018 keynote and confirmed today by the App Store dashboard found on the company’s developer-focused website.

* The 81% figure was calculated by logging devices that accessed App Store on May 31, 2018.
* iOS 11 has been adopted by half of iOS device owners in the first seven weeks of its availability, effectively overtaking iOS 10’s adoption rate during the same timeframe. For context, iOS 11 released for public consumption eight months ago on September 19, 2017.

* iOS 11’s is the fastest-adopted operating system out there, Federighi underscored while revealing that the overall customer satisfaction for iOS 11 has now passed a whopping 95%, despite quality control issues and the numerous reported problems with bugs.

* Apple shared other interesting stats during the WWDC 2018 keynote.
* For example, there are now over 20 million registered Apple developers while App Stores are now seeing 500 million visitors on average each week. More important than that, the Cupertino firm has thus far paid out more than $100 billion to developers from app sales.
