* Contrary to speculative reporting, a next-generation Apple Watch will not switch to a round screen instead as some watchers have been hoping. Moreover, the device’s screen resolution will remain unchanged from the first-generation model.
* According to sources in Asian supply chain who spoke to Taiwanese media, it does however appear that the Apple Watch 2 display will be a tad thinner in order to accommodate a bigger battery.
* Unfortunately, it wasn’t immediately clear whether a bigger battery will let the device run longer on a single charge. Apple typically engineers its mobile devices with a specific battery life target.
* For example, all iPads starting from the original iPad released five years ago and all the way up to the latest iPad Air 2 have been advertised as having a ten-hour battery.
* While a bigger battery would lead to a longer run time between charges, I suspect that added capacity will power new sensors and hardware features.

* In other words, don’t expect longer than the advertised 18-hour battery performance just because Apple Watch 2 is rumored to have a bigger battery inside.
* In terms of display size and resolution, as mentioned before, the second-generation watch should come in two display sizes and resolutions like the inaugural model.
* As a reminder, the 38mm Apple Watch has a 272-by-340 pixel resolute screen measuring 1.32 inches diagonally, or 33.5 millimeter. The 42mm model has a 1.5-inch screen (39 millimeter) sporting 312-by-390 pixels.
* The source said Samsung Display will join LG Display in providing P-OLED panels for the Apple Watch 2. LG Display is an exclusive provider of OLED panels for the current Apple Watch.
* According to another sketchy rumor published by 9to5Mac, the Apple Watch 2 should incorporate a camera integrated into the top bezel for conducting FaceTime video conversations.
