* Apple’s iPhone 4S just keeps on rocking. After garnering stellar sales worldwide and being met with great reviews, a new survey suggests that the people who spend their own money on an iPhone 4S are also pretty happy.
* The survey, conducted by ChangeWave, took in the views of 215 iPhone 4S owners between November 2nd and 9th, with 96% of those questioned saying that they were satisfied with their new smartphone.
* The news gets better, with 77% of those surveyed saying that they are “very satisfied” with the iPhone 4S. When combined with the 19% who were simply “somewhat satisfied,” they make the iPhone 4S the most loved iPhone ever…
* By comparison, the iPhone 4 found itself to be slightly less satisfactory, with 72% of owners “very satisfied” and 21% “somewhat satisfied” with the handset. The increase, whilst not massive, will still be a welcome statistic at Apple HQ.

* Another stat that jumped out at us is the staggering 38% of people who thought the iPhone 4S battery life was too short. With Apple releasing various iOS updates in an attempt to rectify the issue, which has been the topic of great discussion, it is interesting to see that the percentage of sufferers is so high.
* When asked about their favorite iPhone 4S feature, guess what came out first? Siri, of course, with 49% of people surveyed saying that Siri is what they like best about the iPhone 4S.

* We would have liked to have the survey take in more participants than the 215 people questioned in order to get a more accurate picture of what is going on in the minds of iPhone 4S owners, but the numbers make interesting reading regardless.
* Reasons given for the high levels of satisfactions include the new 8 megapixel camera, Siri, and the new iPhone’s overall ease of use. We can’t really argue with any of those points!
* Are you “very satisfied” with your iPhone 4S?
