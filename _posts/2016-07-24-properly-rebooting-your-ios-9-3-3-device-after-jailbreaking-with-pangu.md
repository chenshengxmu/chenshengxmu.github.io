* Those of you who have jailbroken your iOS 9.2-10.2 devices with the Pangu jailbreak tool or the Yalu jailbreak tool should know by now that it’s a semi-untethered jailbreak. This means you have to re-run the jailbreak app from your Home screen every time you reboot your device.
* In this piece, we’ll talk about how to reboot your semi-untethered jailbroken iOS 9.2-10.2 device properly so that Cydia works as expected after your device turns back on.
* A semi-untethered jailbreak is a hybrid between an untethered jailbreak and a tethered jailbreak.
* As you might remember from the redsn0w days, a tethered jailbreak required you to connect your device to a computer and re-run the jailbreak tool in order to re-install Cydia. Untethered jailbreaks are preferred because you can turn your device off and on again and never have an issue running Cydia.
* The semi-untether meets the two in between. With this jailbreak, you don’t need to connect your jailbroken device to a computer, but you do have to re-run the tool that was added to your Home screen every time you reboot your device. Fortunately, this is much more convenient.
* If you don’t… Cydia is going to do this after you reboot:

* But it’s easy to fix; you just need to run the tool that was installed on your device again.
* Because a semi-untethered jailbreak is a relatively odd type of jailbreak that we don’t see that often, we decided it was a good idea to make a tutorial so more people understand the concept.
* If you just had to turn your device off and on again, then you need to know how to get Cydia up and running again. To do that, follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the Pangu/PP app from your Home screen.

* 2) Allow notifications if you’re prompted to do so by tapping on the OK button in the prompt.

* 3) Tap on the circle in the center of the app so it turns into text, then lock your device by pressing the sleep button.

* 4) Now, a notification should appear on your Lock screen and your device may warn you about your storage becoming too full. Just leave your device alone.

* 5) In a few moments, your device should respring itself, and you should be able to launch Cydia again.

* That’s all there is to it! That was way easier than an old-fashioned tethered jailbreak, wasn’t it?
* The semi-untethered jailbreak requires you to re-run the jailbreak tool every time you reboot your device, but it doesn’t require the use of a computer. It’s much more convenient than a tethered jailbreak, but not quite as convenient as an untethered jailbreak.
