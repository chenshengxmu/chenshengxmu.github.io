* Have you been frustrated by Apple’s repair or replacement policy? You could be in for some cash, according to a Friday report.
* The iPhone maker supposedly has signed a settlement deal worth $53 million ending a class action lawsuit that claimed Apple dragged its feet on honoring warranties for the iPhone and iPod touch.
* The settlement, reportedly signed Wednesday by Apple’s head litigation attorney, could affect “hundreds of thousands” of iPhone, iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS owners, as well as people who bought the first three generations of the iPod touch media player…
* Although Apple admits no wrongdoing in the settlement, the company could pay around $200 to the device owners participating in the lawsuit, according to Wired, which obtained a copy of the settlement (PDF document) Thursday.
* The agreement is expected to be filed in a San Francisco, federal court “in the coming weeks.” At the heart of the legal dispute was a piece of white tape included inside the devices.
* Apple routinely denied repair or replacement claims under existing one or two-year warranties if the tape’s color changed to pink or red. While the company maintained the color-change was due to contact with water, the tape’s maker, 3M, said humidity could also cause the different color.
* Indeed, in early 2012 came reports Apple was investigating alternative methods of detecting water-damaged iOS devices.

* Apple has previously made concessions regarding disputed warranty policies, too.
* Recently, CEO Tim Cook apologized to China after state-run media chastised the firm over replacement and repair issues in the 1.33 billion people market.
* The EU has castigated Apple over its warranty practices multiple times and Italy even threatened to close Apple’s offices if a warranty concern wasn’t addressed.
