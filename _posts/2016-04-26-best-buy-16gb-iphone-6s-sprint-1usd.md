* Best Buy is running a new promotion that might interest those who’re in the market for an entry-level iPhone 6s. Just this week, the consumer electronics retailer is offering the entry-level iPhone 6s with sixteen gigabytes of storage for just $1.
* The U.S.-only promotion requires would-be iPhone 6s shoppers to sign a two-year contract with wireless carrier Sprint or commit themselves to one of Sprint’s monthly installment plans that don’t require signing a long-term contract.
* Considering carriers normally offer the 16GB iPhone 6s on a two-year plan for $199.99, you’re looking at some significant savings on the device’s normal price. 64GB and 128GB iPhone 6s models are available in Best Buy’s promotion for $199 and $299, respectively, with a two-year Sprint plan, representing a savings of $100 each.
* Sprint’s installment plans for the 16GB iPhone 6s model start at $26.39 per month (Sprint Lease) until the full retail price of the device ($700) has been paid off, or $27.09 per month over the course of 24 months.
* Those who opt for installment plans will be treated to a $100 Best Buy gift card.
* The iPhone 6s can be purchased on Sprint in Space Gray, Gold, Silver or Rose Gold. The promotion is running starting today until Thursday, April 28, 2016 and is limited to Best Buy’s brick-and-mortar retail stores.
