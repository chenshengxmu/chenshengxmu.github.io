* Apple once again is rated best at providing technical support to consumers, according to Consumer Reports, an influential American magazine published monthly by Consumers Union since 1936. This year’s overall score of 86 out of 100 topped Apple’s 2012 rating, the publication announced.
* Additionally, Apple’s retail Geek Bar solved nearly 90 percent of tech problems, higher than Best Buy’s lookalike Geek Squad bars. The iPhone maker produced the highest survey results, outstripping its nearest competitor, Lenovo, which scored 63. Apple’s success was due to a number of factors, according to the Consumer Reports survey…
* Consumer Reports explains:
* The company scored far higher than the other big companies for the elements that make for successful online and support ease of contacting staff, clarity of advice, technical knowledge, patience, and time for follow-up.
* The survey also found 88 percent of problems presented by consumers were solved by members of Apple’s Genius Bar team, compared to 70 percent for Best Buy.
* Another survey last year found most Apple customers returned to an Apple Store because of free service.
* Would you call this assessment fair?
* And can any tech company touch Apple when it comes to support?
