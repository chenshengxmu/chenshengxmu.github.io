* After several alleged production images and rear shell photos published recently have indicated strongly that one or maybe both new iPhone models could feature an iPod touch-style protruding camera ring on the back, a purported three-dimensional render of a device that resembles the iPhone 6 has surfaced today, showing a camera lens that sticks out between 0.67 and 0.77 millimeters…
* The image top of post was republished from a Chinese source Wednesday by Apple.club.tw [Google Translate] and relayed by GforGames.
* It’s apparently a three-dimensional rendering of a 4.7-inch iPhone 6 that was probably created as part of the production schematic. The Moiré pattern seen on the image points to the conclusion that a source photographed the render on a computer display.
* The website claims that the photo depicts a 4.7-inch device which is ostensibly just 7 millimeters thick.
* The accompanying comments suggest that the first prototype had a camera ring on the back protruding 0.77 millimeters. A device named “Proto2” is mentioned as having the camera ring which sticks out some 0.67 millimeters.
* The “N56” label seen on the photo is an internal code-name for the 4.7-inch iPhone 6. The 5.5-incher has been given a codename of “N61”. French blog NowhereElse.fr was first to report these code-names nearly a month ago.

* Pictured above: the protruding iPhone 6 camera ring that Russian luxury modified iPhone vendor Feld & Volk posted on its Instagram.
* As for the claimed schematic, the “Proto 1” and “Proto 2” labels might point to the conclusion that both handsets — the 4.7-inch version and its 5.5-inch counterpart — feature a camera lens extending outward from the rear cover.
* Alternatively, the image could mean that just one of the two new iPhones has a protruding lens, meaning “Proto 1” and “Proto 2” denote prototypes of a single model.
* Another possibility: the alleged schematic could be for a sixth-generation iPod touch.
* What do you say?
