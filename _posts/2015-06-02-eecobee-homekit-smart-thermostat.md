* First HomeKit-certified devices are beginning to appear ahead of Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference next week. Tuesday, accessory maker Ecobee announced its smart thermostat for the connected home with HomeKit-certified chips for full compatibility with the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
* Soon to replace Ecobee’s existing thermostat that has been selling in Apple’s retail stores, the refreshed third-generation accessory features Wi-Fi connectivity, compatibility with Apple’s HomeKit and integration with Siri so you can control your room’s temperature using spoken commands on your iOS device.
* The company debuted the Wi-Fi connected smart thermostat back in 2009. Filed as the first HomeKit-enabled smart thermostat, the ecobee3 will be available at Apple Stores beginning July 7, priced at $249.
* In terms of compatibility, the company claims its device works with 95 percent of residential heating and cooling systems in North America and does not require a C-wire when using the included Power Extender Kit.

* The thermostat, along with remote sensors, measures temperature and occupancy in multiple locations, helping you save an average of 23 percent on your heating and cooling bill by addressing varying temperatures.
* If you have a change in schedule and you leave your home, the sensors will recognize this and prevent your heating and cooling systems from running unnecessarily when your home is empty.
* You’ll also receive alerts on your iOS device if anything is not working or working sub-optimally, reminders to change your filters, have your equipment serviced and more.
* “As the first HomeKit-enabled smart thermostat, we couldn’t be happier to bring this revolutionary technology to customers,” said Stuart Lombard, president and CEO of ecobee.
* The 15-megabyte app supports Apple Watch and lets you monitor and control your ecobee Smart, Smart Si and ecobee3 thermostats from anywhere, right on your iOS device. Here’s the watch app in action.
* You can manage multiple thermostat with the app, change their individual settings, set your preferred indoor temperature, humidity level, system status, system mode and fan run time and more.
* Other features include viewing your current schedule and temperature settings, current local weather and 4-day weather forecast, checking out the occupancy, participation and connectivity status for your ecobee3 and all wireless remote sensors paired with your thermostat and much more.

* And because HomeKit supports actions, you can chain different actions together and trigger them using Siri, saying something like “Siri, nap time” to turn off the lights and change the temperature at once.
* The ecobee3 app is available free in the App Store.
