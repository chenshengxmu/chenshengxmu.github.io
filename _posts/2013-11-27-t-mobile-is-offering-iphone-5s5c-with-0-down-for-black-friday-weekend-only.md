* Black Friday is just around the corner and TMoNews is reporting that T-Mobile USA will be offering Apple’s iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c with $0 down on its usual installment plans, for the Black Friday weekend only, November 29. Following the weekend, limited time pricing “for these amazing devices” will be available beginning Cyber Monday, December 2, as per the carrier’s internal memo.
* I’m guessing these prices are for entry-level iPhones with sixteen gigabytes of storage. For those wondering, that’s a $149 saving on the iPhone 5s and a $49 saving on the iPhone 5c right off the bat as you’ll be paying about $20 per month for 24 months on T-Mobile’s installment plans. I’ve included the full details right after the break…
* According to T-Mobile’s memo obtained by TMoNews:
* The feeling of giving the perfect gift is unexplainable – especially during the Holidays! Customers have big shopping lists and unmeasurable determination to find the best deals for the best gift.
* Beginning Black Friday, customers can finish their shopping early because the perfect gifts are at the perfect price at T-Mobile.
* TMoNews has learned that a select number of stores will be accepting orders from Thursday evening, with staff having been instructed “to print and place new iPhone price cards and have them in place for store opening on November 29”.
* If you’re going to buy an Apple handset from T-Mobile on Cyber Monday, you’ll be looking at $9.99 down for the iPhone 5c and $49.99 down for the iPhone 5s.
* “In-store pricing on Cyber Monday will differ from what’s available on T-Mobile.com,” the publication cautions.

* T-Mobile’s offer one-ups Walmart’s $45 iPhone 5c deal, based on a free $75 gift card with the Black Friday purchase of an iPhone 5s/5c
* If you ask Google’s Eric Schmidt, “a great Christmas present to an iPhone user” would be one of the latest high-end phones from Samsung (Galaxy S4), Motorola (Verizon Droid Ultra) and the Nexus 5 (for AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile) because these phones “have better screens, are faster and have a much more intuitive interface”.
