* Two days after seeding iOS 9 beta 3 and OS X 10.11.4 beta 3 to developers, Apple has made the updates available to public testers. Folks who are registered in the company’s Beta Software Program can now install the new firmware on their various devices.
* As usual, the new iOS 9.3 beta is available over-the-air via the Settings app to those already running 9.3, and the new El Capitan 10.11.4 beta can be found in the Updates tab of the Mac App Store. You just need to make sure your Mac or device is enrolled.
* Apple has added a number of new features in iOS 9.3, including a new night-time reading mode called Night Shift, password protection for the Notes app, and much more. Beta 3 doesn’t build on that much, outside of the addition of Verizon Wi-Fi Calling.
* As for OS X 10.11.4, most of its changes are under-the-hood. The update does include support for Live Photos and Notes passwords, but other than that there aren’t many user-facing additions—although beta 3 does fix a high-profile issue with Twitter links.
* Apple is expected to release the two updates to the general public sometime next month.
