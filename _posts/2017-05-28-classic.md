* Love them or hate them, iOS 10 came with redesigned notification banners that look starkly different from those in iOS 7, 8, and 9.
* If like many others, you miss the way notifications looked in earlier versions of iOS, then you might enjoy using a new free jailbreak tweak dubbed Classic by nathanaccidentally.
* After installing Classic, you’re provided with a handful of options for changing how your notification banners look.
* Classic affects banner notifications throughout iOS, so in addition to changing how things look on the Lock screen as shown above, the tweak also changes to your Notification Center and system-wide notification banners:

* Classic puts a preferences pane in the Settings app where you can configure your banner notification aesthetics to your liking:

* Among the things you can do here are:
* A respring button is included in the preferences pane so you can save your changes.
* Pay close attention to the version of iOS you have; notifications in iOS 10.1.1 behave differently than they do in iOS 10.2. For this reason, you should only turn on the “10.1.1” switch if you’re jailbroken on iOS 10.1.1; conversely, turn the switch off if you’re on iOS 10.2.
* Classic makes notification banners much squarer than they typically are out of the box on iOS 10, and this helps replicate the older look and feel. It’s not a perfect replication of banner notifications from the times of yore, but at least it’s a closer resemblance than it used to be.
* We did notice a bug in this version of the tweak where the right side of the notification banner touches the edge of the display. The same problem doesn’t appear to occur with the left side of the banner, and hopefully this will be addressed in a future update.
* Classic’s changes are fully aesthetic, so some might enjoy the look while others won’t; it comes down to difference of opinion, and if you’re interested in trying the tweak, it’s available for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. Classic works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
