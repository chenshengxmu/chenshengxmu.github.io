title: The Croods- Official game hitting iOS on March 14
---
* We have decided to stop telling you about Angry Birds content updates because of the excessive franchise milking, but this brand new game is worth mentioning. So Rovio teamed up with DreamWorks Animation on the official game for The Croods CG animated feature film.
* The game is due for release on an Apple and Google app store near your on Thursday, March 14 and follows the Croods as they hunt and gather their way through “spectacular new landscapes as they tame fantastic and never-seen-before creatures,” or so says the blurb. The above teaser highlights custom animation from DreamWorks and I’ve also included gameplay clip right below…
* According to Rovio, the game will task players with helping the Croods breaking out of the Stone Age “with the use of a new r-evolutionary tool: the IDEA”.
* This is the official gameplay trailer.
* The Croods movie is hitting theaters on March 22 in Real 3D and Digital 3D.
* Here’s the official trailer.
* From the studio’s blurb:
* The Croods, in theaters in 3D on March 22, tells the story of the world’s first family road trip. When their cave is destroyed, the Crood family must embark on a comedy adventure into strange and spectacular territory in search of a new home.
* As if patriarch Grug didn’t already have enough to handle, it goes from bad to worse when they encounter an imaginative nomad named Guy. With Guy’s help the Croods conquer their fear of the outside world and discover that they have exactly what it takes to survive – each other.
* Animation looks superb, but it remains to be seen whether the project is capable of reviving the ailing DreamWorks Animation studio, especially with Disney’s Pixar ruling the animated storytelling landscape.
