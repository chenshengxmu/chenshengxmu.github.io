* In the shadow of intuitive notification systems from Palm and other competitors, the iOS push notification system is certainly lacking. Luckily there are some great utilities for us jailbroken folks to change the look and feel of your iOS notifications.
* Although tweaks like MobileNotifier look promising, they don’t seem quite reliable yet to handle the daily grind. But don’t worry, there’s still hope to bring a revamped notification system to your current device…
* Notified Pro isn’t a new app by any means, and neither is the GriP plugin. But if you combine the 2 utilities and sprinkle on a little bit of Popup Blocker, you can have the notification system on your iPhone you’ve always dreamed of.
* For folks who haven’t heard of Notified Pro, it’s basically an app that intercepts iOS notifications and keeps them logged and organized for later review. Think of it like a Facebook timeline of notifications from all of your apps.
* The GriP plugin is an extension of Notified Pro and can build customizable alert messages to replace the boring blue boxes in iOS. I’ve tweaked mine a certain way to resemble the old MobileNotifier style, but you can alter it however you want.

* You can also set the messages to appear at the top of the screen or at the bottom, either spot is much more out of the way than Apple’s in your face alerts. Once a notification pops up, you can tap x to clear the alert message or tap the icon to launch the corresponding application.

* The backbone to this entire plan is Popup Blocker. While Notified Pro can intercept alert messages and spit out pretty new ones, most of the time it doesn’t block the old ones. So without Popup Blocker, you’ll likely be getting double notifications which kind of defeats the purpose.
* As I mentioned earlier, the reason why I prefer this method is reliability. I haven’t seen a single ghost image or screen flicker – things I’ve experienced with other options. The only time it’s acted up is when it kicked me into safe mode while editing my GriP Bar, so not a big deal.
* If you want to experience notification nirvana, pop into Cydia and start downloading. Notified Pro will run you $2.99 but Notification Grip is a free extension. Popup Blocker will run you just under a buck, and all apps can be found in the default repos.
* I know a lot of you have tried this already, What do you think? Do you prefer another way to get your notifications?
