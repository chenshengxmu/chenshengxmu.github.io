* CES starts today, meaning you can expect to see several new product and accessory announcements over the next 5 days. Earlier today we told you about the Cookoo smart watch, and now it’s Belkin’s time to shine.
* Known for Apple accessories like USB cables and keyboard cases, Belkin doesn’t have much of a track record in the audio space. That changes, though, with the Thunderstorm, a new iPad case with built-in speakers…
* The Belkin Thunderstorm is essentially a portable audio dock built into an iPad case. It actually reminds a lot of the ORA speaker-case we took a look at in November, but obviously with Belkin’s trademark fit and finish.
* Here are some of the case’s more notable features listed in Belkin’s press release (via Engadget):
* Belkin has also created an iPad app for the Thunderstorm that will allow users extended control of the speaker case, with three different soundscapes: music, cinematic and action. Obviously the app will be free of charge.
* The Thunderstorm, however, isn’t quite the bargain. It’ll run you $199. And the worst part is, it’s only compatible with 30-pin devices at the moment. But Belkin does say that a Lightning version will be available in Q2.
* So, what’s your take on the Thunderstorm? Worth the money?
