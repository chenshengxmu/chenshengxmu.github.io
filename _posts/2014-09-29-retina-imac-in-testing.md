* A rumored 27-inch iMac with a Retina screen featuring a “5K” resolution of 5,120-by-2,880 pixels is reportedly in late testing stages within Apple, as first reported Monday morning by Jack March and corroborated by 9to5Mac.
* The reported “5K” resolution would quadruple pixel count versus the 2,560-by-1,440 resolution panel on the current 27-inch iMac model. To drive all those pixels, Apple is said to outfit the forthcoming all-in-one desktop with AMD’s pro-grade graphics utilized on the late-2013 Mac Pro, as opposed to Nvidia GPU’s powering the current iMac lineup.
* The machine should be unveiled at Apple’s next major media event.
* Multiple rumors have suggested that Apple will soon issue invites for an October press event to refresh the iPad lineup and launch OS X Yosemite.
* “A source familiar with Apple’s plans tells me that Apple is indeed planning to launch a Retina iMac at their next press event,” March reported.
* Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac confirmed this with his sources “who have used the future desktop computer”. March claims that only the 27-incher will feature a 5,120-by-2,880 panel, as leaked in the OSX Yosemite code a few months ago. Specifically, watchers spotted references to 6,400-by-3,600, 5,760-by-3,240 and 4,096-by-2,304 resolution screens in Yosemite betas.
* March’s source is “almost 100 percent sure” that the 21.5-inch model should continue to use the current full HD 1,920-by-1,080 screen.
* “The source says that its likely that the 21.5″ model will get a Retina display when powerful Broadwell processors start shipping,” wrote March.
* This would be in line with Apple’s current MacBook offering, that comes in two flavors: Retina and non-Retina. March also added that the new 27-inch model would continue to use Intel’s Haswell Core i7-4790K processor clocked at 4.0 GHz because next-generation Broadwell chips won’t be ready until next year.
* The machine should feature the same thin design as the current model, with improved Wi-Fi antennas. Port configuration is said to remain largely intact.
* Apple has been expected to unveil a brand new 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display, but that machine is also thought to have been delayed because low-power Broadwell chips won’t be available in volume until mid-2015.
* Taiwan-based display researchers WitsView believes that a “5K” Retina-class Apple Thunderbolt Display is in the works as well.
