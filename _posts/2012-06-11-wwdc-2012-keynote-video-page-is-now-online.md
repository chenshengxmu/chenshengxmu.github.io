* Apple has just published a dedicated WWDC keynote stream page to its website, it’s available right here.
* Apple will hopefully release the full presentation as a high-definition downloadable podcast via their dedicated Apple Keynotes section in iTunes…
* Feel free to come back here after watching the presentation to share your impressions on how Cook & Co did.
