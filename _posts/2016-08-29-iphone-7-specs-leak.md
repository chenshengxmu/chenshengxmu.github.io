* Alleged specifications of Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus refresh were leaked this morning on the Chinese social network Weibo by an unknown source. The document appears to detail several technical aspects of the forthcoming devices, including display resolutions, next-generation cameras, chips, batteries and other features.
* According to the leak, the handsets will predictably run Apple’s in-house designed ‘A10’ system-on-a-chip that has an embedded next-generation ‘M10’ motion coprocessor. Unfortunately, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will reportedly retain the same screen resolution of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus series.
* The 4.7-inch iPhone 7 model is said to come outfitted with two gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM like the current iPhone 6 series, while RAM on the bigger 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus device is said to be three gigabytes of LPDDR4 due to increased image processing requirements by a dual-lens camera system.

* As for the battery, the iPhone 7 is said to have a 1,960 mAh battery while its 5.5-inch brethren should come with a 2,910 mAh battery, representing a slight increase for both models over the iPhone 6 series.
* Next, the 4.7-incher is said to have a twelve-megapixel camera with a 1/2.6″ sensor versus the twelve-megapixel 1/3″ sensor on the iPhone 6s). Camera aperture on the iPhone 7 is reportedly ƒ/1.9 (versus 2.2 on the iPhone 6s) and the sensor apparently has 1.3 µm pixels.
* The flagship iPhone 7 Plus model will have two twelve-megapixel shooters out the back, each outfitted with a 1/3″ sensor and a ƒ/1.9 aperture. The leaked specs do not give specifications for pixel size on the dual-lens module.
