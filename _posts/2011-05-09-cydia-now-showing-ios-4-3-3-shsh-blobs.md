* I’ve seen countless complaints in the comments regarding saved SHSH blobs using TinyUmbrella not showing up in Cydia. Well, I can finally expect to see those complaints put to a rest (at least until Apple rolls out another iOS update) as Cydia now shows all saved iOS SHSH blobs up to the latest iOS 4.3.3.
* If you’ve launched Cydia today, you’ll notice that if you previously saved your SHSH blobs for iOS 4.3.1, iOS 4.3.2, and iOS 4.3.3 they’ll now appear in the top banner on the Cydia homepage on your iDevice. 
* As we’ve mentioned previously, when you save your SHSH blobs using TinyUmbrella, the reason why they do not appear instantly is because saurik must update Cydia (internally) to show the new saved SHSH blobs. When you use TinyUmbrella to save your SHSH blobs, TinyUmbrella automatically saves the SHSH blob in a folder on your computer in addition to sending a copy to Cydia as well.
* The latest version of TinyUmbrella (version 4.33.00) supports iOS 4.3.3, but according to TinyUmbrella developer @notcom, there is an issue with Cydia which is preventing the SHSH blobs for iOS 4.3.3 to be saved and sent to Cydia. Notcom states that Saurik has been notified regarding the issue and it should be resolved shortly. We’ll let you know when the issue has been resolved.
