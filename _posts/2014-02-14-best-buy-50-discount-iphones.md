* Folks looking to score an iPhone in the near future may want to check out their local Best Buy. Starting Sunday, February 16, the retailer will start discounting iPhone models by $50 as long as they’re purchased with a two-year contract.
* The promotion will apply to all late iPhone models, for subscribers on AT&T, Sprint and Verizon Wireless. And to give you an idea of what it will look like, the 16GB iPhone 5 will come down to free, the 5c $50, and the iPhone 5s $150…
* Now, this is separate from the gift card deal we told you about in January, which gives any customer who reserves a new phone purchase with Best Buy by February 15 a $50 gift card. We’re not sure if the two deals can be combined.

* CNET notes that there are other Apple promos ending this weekend. Retina iPad mini models are $50 off, and bringing in a working iPad scores you a Best Buy gift card of up to $200, depending on model/condition. Both end Saturday.
* While none of these offers appear substantial, they do give you a chance to score discounts on Apple hardware during this off-holiday season. Remember, the $50 off iPhone promo begins Sunday, and ends next Saturday, February 22.
