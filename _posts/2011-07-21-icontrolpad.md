* Alright folks, it’s finally here. We told you about the iControlPad nearly 3 years ago, and the company has finally started shipping the product. For those unfamiliar with the gaming accessory, let me give you a quick refresher.
* When you think of iPhone gaming add-ons, you typically think of those little plastic suction-cup-tipped joysticks. iControlPad provides a much better solution for your touchscreen woes with physical, console-like controls…
* iControlPad looks like a typical game controller. It has 4 action buttons, a D-pad, and 2 joysticks. It connects to your iPhone (and several other compatible devices) via Bluetooth.
* The accessory comes with an adjustable plastic frame that allows for various phone-sized devices to be attached. The end result looks kind of like a modified Sega Game Gear. Still having trouble picturing it? Check out the video below.
* It would seem like after 3 years of development, the product would be perfect, right? Wrong. The iControlPad still has some major hurdles to overcome if it wants to see any kind of success.
* The most important is compatibility. While the iControlPad can be used on un-jailbroken devices, not all of the features work. You guessed it, an Apple restriction on 3rd party developers doesn’t allow the Bluetooth actions needed for the joysticks to function.
* Jailbreakers on the other hand, can utilize all of the controls. There have been several demo videos released of folks using the iControlPad with popular emulators like psx4iPhone and snes4iphone.
* It’ll certainly take a lot of support from 3rd party developers to help the iControlPad elevate above the rest of the made-for-iPhone controllers. While we’re at it, they may also want to do something about its hefty $69.99 price tag.
* What do you think of the iControlPad?
