* As we told you a bit earlier in the day, if you’re using a tethered jailbreak for iOS 6.1 via the RedSn0w method, then you can easily convert that tethered jailbreak into an untethered jailbreak by means of a Cydia package.
* Indeed, by downloading the evasi0n package from Cydia, you can transition over to an untethered jailbreak in just a few steps. While this isn’t perhaps the most ideal way to achieve an untethered jailbreak, it is nice to have the option. This is especially useful for users who already have a ton of Cydia packages downloaded. By using this method, you don’t have to reinstall all of your Cydia apps and tweaks. Given the state of Cydia right now, that’s a very desirable proposition.
* Take a look inside, as we show you how easy it is to convert your tethered jailbreak into an untethered jailbreak.
* Step 1: Again, this is assuming that you already have a tethered jailbreak on a pre-A5 device. If your device isn’t already jailbroken using RedSn0w’s tethered jailbreak method, then you should instead read our how to jailbreak using evasi0n tutorial. This tutorial is only valid for pre-A5 devices only, like the iPhone 4, or iPod touch 4th generation. All post-A5 devices need not apply here.
* Step 2: Open Cydia, and search for evasi0n.
* Step 3: Install the evasi0n 6.x Untether package, and reboot.
* Step 4: Enjoy your newly untethered jailbreak.
* Yep, that’s all there is to it. Simply install the evasi0n package from Cydia, and you too can enjoy a jailbreak in untethered fashion.
* This isn’t the first time that we’ve been able to convert a jailbreak from tethered to untethered. If you can remember, the Chronic Dev Team released an untether package for the iOS 5.1.1 jailbreak called Rocky Racoon. This package, like the evasi0n package, allowed users to convert prior tethered jailbreaks into the more desirable untethered variety.
* Maybe you’re wondering what all of the fuss is about? Perhaps you’re thinking, “isn’t a jailbreak just a jailbreak?” While that is true, untethered jailbreaks are much more desireable, because they allow for greater flexibility. With a tethered jailbreak, you must connect to your computer any time you wish to reboot. That’s how it got the named “tethered”, because you were essentially tethered back to your computer anytime your device shut off, or even accidently restarted for any reason.
* An untethered jailbreak gets rid of this chain. With it, you can reboot as much as you want without any consequences. If you never reconnected your device back to your computer, that would be perfectly fine, because it is untethered.
