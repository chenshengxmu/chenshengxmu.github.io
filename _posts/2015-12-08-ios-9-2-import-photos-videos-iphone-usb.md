* The just released iOS 9.2 brings with it something that iPhone users have been wanting for quite some time now: the ability to import photos directly from a USB source via Apple’s USB Camera Adapter. Data transfer is still going to operate at USB 2.0 speeds, but having the option to work on videos and photos shot on traditional cameras is a nice new perk for iPhone users.

* If you’ve updated to iOS 9.2, that should no longer be the case. This update comes right on the heels of Apple’s release of a new Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader, which is specifically geared towards the iPad Pro. That device does support USB 3.0 speeds (iPad Pro only), which is much more appropriate for today’s high quality videos.
