* Taiwanese handset maker HTC today at CES 2018 unveiled an upgraded edition of its Vive virtual reality headset that Apple recommends for VR content development on macOS.
* The new VR headset features increased pixel count for higher-fidelity graphics, built-in headphones and other perks. With a resolution of 2,880-by-1,600 pixels via its two OLED displays, the headset provides crisper visuals at 615 pixels per inch and more details with 78 percent more pixels compared to the current Vive headset at 2,160-by-1,200 pixels.
* The built-in headphones come with an integrated amplifier to offer a heightened sense of presence and an overall richer sound. Other features include a redesigned headstrap with a sizing dial for a more balanced operation that decreases weight on the front of the headset, dual microphones with active noise cancellation and dual front-facing cameras.
* No pricing or availability information was released at post time, but HTC promised to reveal additional information in the not-so-distant future.
* Additionally, HTC debuted a new Vive Wireless Adaptor that will enable a truly wireless VR headset integration (via Intel’s WiGig technology) for both Vive and Vive Pro, as well as some notable improvements in how users discover, experience and acquire VR content through a major redesign of the built-in Viveport VR and Vive Video apps.
* Instead of a traditional 2D catalog, the new Viveport VR service is delivered in fully immersive interactive previews, giving users a room-scale preview of an experience and the chance to interact with the content before they purchase or subscribe.
* As a quick refresher, Apple is rumored to be developing an AR/VR accessory of its own.
