* Apple released a software update for iTunes on Thursday that has been made available via the Mac App Store. The update comes with some minor improvements to the software.
* Bringing the software up to version 12.4.1, this update is mostly a bug fix release and is recommended for everyone who uses iTunes.
* The iTunes 12.4.1 update is minor and mostly has to do with fixing bugs that were present in the previous release.
* Noted in the release’s change log, as shown in the Mac App Store, the following changes were made in the update:
* This update addresses a number of problems where iTunes doesn’t work as expected with VoiceOver. It also restores the option to Reset Plays and fixes the following issues:
* The update is shown making improvements to VoiceOver’s usability, as well as fixing a problem that could cause songs added to an Up Next list to play in the wrong order under rare circumstances and fixing a problem that could prevent iTunes from using the crossfade effect between songs as the songs change from one to the next.
* The iTunes 12.4.1 update comes about two weeks after the initial release of iTunes 12.4, which included some minor redesigns to the app to make navigation a little more fluid and easier to use. Those improvements included a refreshed look for the sidebar and improvements to the forward and back buttons in the app, among other things.
* Mac users can grab the update from the Mac App Store’s Updates tab. You may even be prompted by your Mac to install software updates when they’re available via a banner notification.

* Once you’re there, you’ll click on the Update or Update All button to the right of the update and it’ll begin downloading and installing on your computer. No restart is going to be required unlike with OS X operating system updates.
* The update is indeed minor, but it is recommended for all users to ensure everyone has the best user experience possible. Because it’s minor, you don’t need to be in any rush to install it, however.
* How are you liking iTunes since the 12.4 design refresh? Share in the comments!
