* iOS 11 is releasing later today and it’s the software update you don’t want to pass on. Apple’s latest and greatest mobile operating system is packed with an array of awesome new features and countless productivity enhancements, refinements and under-the-hood improvements.
* To ensure a smooth transition, be sure to read this guide and prepare your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch properly for iOS 11 before you download the update.
* If you’re jailbroken and intend to stay jailbroken, best thing you disregard this post and stay away from iOS 11 for the time being because upgrading to iOS 11 will cost you your jailbreak.
* Folks who are not jailbroken and don’t intend to jailbreak in the near future should follow the instructions in this post so the installation goes as smoothly as possible.
* iOS 11 officially drops support for 32-bit devices.
* Older hardware like iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c is definitely out out of the picture. According to the official iOS 11 system requirements,, the following 64-bit devices are supported by Apple’s software update:
* iPhone
* iPad
* iPod touch
* To update to iOS 11, you’ll need the following:
* Be sure you have your Apple ID password ready.
* People forget their login details all the time, especially with the convenience of Touch ID. If it’s been a while since the last time you had to use your Apple ID, make sure you have your credentials ready as you’ll need them during the iOS 11 setup process to authorize services like iCloud and App Store and access your cloud content such as contacts, calendars, photos, videos and more.
* The last thing you want is to be spending additional time sending a password recovery email to yourself and go through the hoops of recovering a forgotten password to regain access to your Apple ID account.
* Don’t forget to get in a range of a Wi-Fi network because iOS 11 cannot be downloaded over cellular. You can’t even download it via your Mac without a Wi-Fi connection. Not everyone is going to be in range of a Wi-Fi network when iOS 11 drops. Some people might be at work, out camping, or perhaps just out and about where public Wi-Fi networks don’t exist, so do plan ahead.
* If you have a passcode set up on your device, you will need to type it in before updating to iOS 11.
* You should create a full backup of your device in iCloud or create an archive backup in desktop iTunes so you have something to revert to if something gone awry.
* Usually, software updates go pretty smoothly, but at times bugs in the download or glitches in the install process can leave you with having to restore in iTunes and losing all of your data.
* Before all major upgrades, you should back up your device.
* Doing this through iTunes might be faster if you have a slower Internet connection, but remember to create an archived backup which saves the current state of your iOS device and prevents it from being overwritten by subsequent backups.
* 1) Connect your device to desktop iTunes.
* 2) Select This Computer underneath the Backups heading, choose Encrypt iPhone Backup and set your backup password. Be sure to store it in safe place. Without the password, you won’t be able to restore your device from an iTunes backup.

* 3) Click Back Up Now.
* Depending on the type of your device, storage size, apps you have installed, user data and other factors, it may take a while to complete the process. You’ll end up with an encrypted backup that also contains all your passwords, Health and HomeKit data and more.
* 4) Now choose Preferences from the iTunes menu and click the Devices tab.
* 5) Right-click your newly-created backup and select Archive from the popup menu.

* Your backup should now be labeled with the date and the time it was archived.
* On the other hand, if you don’t have a computer to do this with, you can use iCloud to back up your data. If anything goes wrong, it’s easy to just restore from that backup and migrate all of your personal data and settings back to your device.
* iOS 11 makes setting up your device a lot easier with a new Automatic Setup feature.
* It makes transferring settings and apps from your old to new device an effortless affair. You simply scan an Apple Watch-like pattern displayed on your device with your new device’s camera, which authenticates it for data transfer. Not only that, but Automatic Setup also makes setting up your device from scratch faster than ever before.

* With just a few taps, your device will be up and running in no time. After signing in with your Apple ID on the setup screen, iOS 11 will do most of the manual work on your behalf, setting up not only iCloud but services like iMessage, FaceTime and more, all in one go.

* Like before, you can also restore your device from an iTunes or iCloud backup which transfers all of your apps and their data along with user settings and more. You may be asked to update your current backup in iCloud and use that to restore to your new device or set it up from scratch.

* As mentioned, you should back up your device in iTunes or iCloud before updating to iOS 11.
*  
* The iOS update process gets better every year, but you can count that users are going to be slamming Apple’s download servers at exactly the same time. It’s understandable that everyone’s going to be infatuated with having the latest and greatest and will rush to download the update, but servers can only handle so much bandwidth at a time.
* In other words, expect delays, download errors or even slow downloads. As a rule of thumb, plan your day ahead of time so that slow downloads don’t ruin any plans you might have made.
* Due to the 64-bit requirement, iOS 11 does not run legacy 32-bit apps.
* Thankfully, Apple provides an easy way to identify any 32-bit apps you have installed on your device that you won’t be able to launch and use after upgrading to iOS 11:
* 1) Venture to Settings → General → About.
* 2) Tap Applications.

* If nothing happens upon tapping Applications, all of the apps installed on your device are 64-bit and you have nothing to worry about. If you have one or more 32-bit apps on the device, tapping Applications takes you to an App Compatibility screen.

* This is where you’ll see all the legacy apps installed on your device.
* “These apps may slow down your iPhone and will not work with future versions of iOS if they are not updated,” reads the feature’s description on iOS versions 10.3-11. On iOS 11 and later, the message clearly states that 32-bit apps will not work unless they’re updated.

* While iOS 10.3-11 still allows you to launch and use 32-bit apps at the expense of system performance and battery life, iOS 11 no longer supports legacy apps and won’t even let you open them. If no compatibility updates are available for your favorite apps, try contacting their developers for more information.
* One of the major new features in iOS 11 is ARKit, Apple’s new framework for building augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad. First ARKit-powered apps are now going live on App Store, but keep in mind that your device must use Apple’s A9 processor or later to support augmented reality experiences.

* The following devices are officially supported by ARKit:
* Older devices, such as iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4 and iPhone 6, won’t run ARKit-enabled apps.
* iOS 11 is one of the best software updates Apple has ever made, period.
* For starters, it sports a ton of subtle visual tweaks that address many annoyances stemming from a major visual overhaul that the operating system underwent a few years back starting with iOS 7.
* But more important than that, iOS 11 is packed with cool new platform technologies and meaningful outward-facing enhancements across the system, like a revamped and customizable Control Center and iPad-only features such as an interactive new Dock, drag and drop between apps, enhanced multitasking modes and much more.

* To help you get started with iOS 11 so you an start exploring all of the goodies Apple’s software update has to offer, be sure to read the official release notes for iOS 11:
* These are not the only iOS 11 features because Apple’s official changelogs often omit minor enhancements. As an example, iOS 11 brings native FLAC playback to iPhone 7, iPhone 8 and iPhone X although the official release notes don’t mention FLAC support.
