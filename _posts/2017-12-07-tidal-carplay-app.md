* Beleaguered streaming service Tidal has now been updated with support for CarPlay, as well as the new edge-to-edge OLED display on iPhone X.
* iPhone X and CarPlay support came included in the latest version of Tidal’s app for iPhone and iPad. This means that users can now play Tidal music streams through their cars, using CarPlay-compatible infotainment systems.

* This is the second major app to gain CarPlay support, as we recently saw SiriusXM get updated, too. For iPhone X users out there, the dark theme of the the Tidal app takes full advantage of the OLED display and the size of the updated OLED display.
* Tidal is available as a free download from the App Store.
