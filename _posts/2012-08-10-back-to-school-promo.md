* Looking for something to do this weekend? Beat the heat by spending your long Saturday, or lazy Sunday, afternoon indoors playing video games on your iPhone or iPad.
* And if you don’t have any cool games to play, EA has you covered. The studio has taken up to 80% off some of its most popular iOS titles as part of its Back to School promotion…
* A number of Electronic Arts’ iPhone and iPad games are on sale right now, but we figured we share a few our favorites:
* Keep in mind that some of these titles typically run as much as $6.99, so needless to say there’s some good deals to be had. But you better hurry. The promotion started on August 4th, and the only thing that we’re sure of is that it should last through the weekend.
* Did you find any good deals today?
