* Work on Apple’s massive flying saucer-shaped Campus 2 building may be completed in time for the planed January 2017 opening after all. New drone footage, courtesy of Matthew Roberts, reveals that the underground auditorium where future media events and corporate meetings will be held is nearly finished, with other structures progressing nicely, too.
* The clip offers an overview of a 100,000 square foot fitness center, a research and development center located next to the main iSpaceship building, multiple tunnels scattered throughout the site, the last iSpaceship section being framed, massive glass panels and solar panels on the building’s rooftops and more.
* Here’s Matthew’s aerial drone footage, captured by a DJI Phantom 3 Professional.
* And here’s another one, captured by Duncan Sinfield.
* Apple Campus 2, or iSpaceship as it’s affectionally called, has 2.8 million square feet in total. The company plans to move in employees by the end of January 2017, according to CEO Tim Cook at the ‘Let us loop you in’ media event.
* Unfortunately, a pair of excellent ground-level videos that were posted five days ago by another YouTubber have since been removed.

* Those impressive clips put us at the center of the action, right within the iSpaceship site, offering a look at the structure’s inner courtyard and underground access tunnels. One of the videos depicted a truck driver entering and driving through the site’s Gate 5 tunnel.
