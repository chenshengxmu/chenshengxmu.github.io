* 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman has received word from sources, which indicate Apple’s eventual release of a brand new SKU in the full-sized iPad lineup. The report aligns well with the 128GB iOS device finding that we posted in the early hours this morning.
* Interestingly, Gurman’s sources pinpoint the exact device lineup that the SKU is targeted to hit — the full-sized forth generation iPad with Retina Display.
* As per normal Apple internal designations, this latest SKU is labeled Ultimate, which, obviously, indicates that it is a step above the GOOD (16GB), BETTER (32GB), and BEST (64GB) models. Although nothing can be 100% confirmed about the features of this new model, given the findings as of late, it’s highly probable that the upgrade will include a storage bump.
* Along with 128GB of storage space, the Ultimate designation may carry with it additional features, but the design will remain consistent with that of current fourth-gen models. 9to5Mac conjectures that this new SKU could be made exclusively for specific agencies — i.e. universities, government, etc. For a few more interesting tidbits, check out the complete post at the link below.
