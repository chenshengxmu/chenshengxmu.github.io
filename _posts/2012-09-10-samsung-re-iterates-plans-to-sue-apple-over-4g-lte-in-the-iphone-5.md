* The world’s leading cell phone and smartphone maker wasn’t kidding when it promised to sue Apple as soon as the iPhone 5 comes out over an alleged breach of its wireless patents related to the fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (LTE) radio technology.
* This morning, unnamed Samsung executives told a Samsung-friendly publication that the Galaxy maker will target Apple’s key markets in Europe and even the U.S., Apple’s home-turf. With Apple struggling to invalidate HTC’s two LTE-related patents in another suit, perhaps Samsung has a shot at disrupting the iPhone 5 launch?
* A senior Samsung executive who is “directly involved with the matter” told Kim Yoo-chul of The Korea Times in a phone interview Monday morning that the South Korean conglomerate will sue the next iPhone over 4G LTE wireless patents the second it hits store shelves:
* It’s true that Samsung Electronics has decided to take immediate legal action against the Cupertino-based Apple. Countries in Europe and even the United States ― Apple’s home-turf ― are our primary targets.
* The story is an extension of a similar report published on August 30.
* Interestingly, an SK Telecom official informally confirmed news that talks with Apple regarding the next iPhone and its support for SK-specific LTE frequencies “ended with a good result”. The source confirmed that SK will in fact “offer the much speedier new iPhone to our customers”.
* You’re probably wondering why bother, right?
* I mean, Samsung just lost a high-profile U.S. suit, with over a billion dollars in damages awarded to Apple and the jury ruling that Cupertino violated none of Samsung’s patents while rejecting every one of Samsung’s instances to invalidate Apple’s patented technology.
* But it only takes one bullet to kill.

* Apple only has one smartphone family – the iPhone – and if anyone manages to provide in litigation that Apple’s devices infringe on other people’s patents, door will open to a sales ban which could have devastating consequences to Apple’s fortunes.
* Apple is now basically an iPhone company and any disruption to the iPhone biz will spook investors and hurt price of its shares, not to mention a huge drop in revenues and earnings.
* That’s why Samsung is launching new suits despite losing the big one in the U.S. The ruling increases likelihood of a possible U.S. ban of iPhone and iPad devices
* Samsung has by some estimates 12.2 percent of the world’s 4G LTE portfolio of patents. However, many of these are said to be standard-essential patents so Samsung will faces an uphill struggle convincing the court that Apple infringes upon technology that is essential to the mobile industry.
* Another Samsung executive commented:
* Apple claimed the existing 3G-related patents are standard essential patents (SEPs) according to our earlier commitment to the FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) terms. But the story is totally different when you talk about LTE patents. These are new and highly-valued,’’ said another Samsung executive.
* Last Thursday, a judge said Apple may struggle to invalidate HTC’s two LTE-related patents, increasing the likelihood of a possible sales ban on the iPhone and iPad devices in the U.S. HTC’s victory could have positive effects on Samsung’s legal attack on the iPhone 5.
* However, let’s not forget that the next iPhone is believed to feature LTE networking by way of a Qualcomm chip and Qualcomm has licensed 3G/4G technology from patent holders.
* That being said, it’ll be interesting seeing how Samsung wiggles its way out of this one.
* Though Samsung never won a clean victory in any of the cases spread across ten countries around the world, perhaps they’re hoping a high-profile suit against the iPhone 5 may disrupt sales and divert some of the pent up demand in its direction?
