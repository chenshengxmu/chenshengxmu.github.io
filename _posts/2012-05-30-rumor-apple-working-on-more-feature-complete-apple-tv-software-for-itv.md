* According to a new report, Apple is readying a much more feature-complete version of the operating system that drives its Apple TV set-top box.
* Sources tell it’s also bound to power that rumored HD TV set. It wasn’t immediately clear from the report whether the enhanced OS will also support the $99 hockey puck and how it might tie with iOS 6.
* The company will allegedly launch it at the upcoming WWDC developers conference in San Francisco which begins with a keynote on June 11 at 10am PST…
* Boy Genius Report has the story:
* We’ve heard Apple is actively trying to court manufacturers to use a new “control out” API in order for third-party manufacturers to make accessories that are compatible with the new Apple TV OS and the upcoming “iTV.”
* It’s said that by using the API, it will be possible to control any connected components all from the Apple remote (and the Apple remote iOS app as well, we’re assuming).
* Author and editor Jonathan Geller stopped short of naming this “trusted source” in his story. My own sources were unable to corroborate Geller’s report.
* So in a nutshell, this API would let third-parties build accessories allowing your iTV to control various devices, similar to the accessories control APIs in iOS.
* I like the idea of bringing order to the mess that is my living room, with so many confusing remotes to control various boxes.
* The control out API is said to work with all aspects of various popular components, even allowing control over things like program guides on a cable operators’ set top boxes and other hardware components.
* Theoretically speaking, an updated iOS Remote app should let us control “various popular components” via our iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* It’s unclear how Apple’s current infrared remote would lend itself to the API.
* Perhaps a brand new Apple Remote hardware is in the works?
* I was kinda hoping that an HD TV from Apple would run iOS 6.
* The rumor makes sense to the extent that Apple would want to provide developers with a working build of a new Apple TV software so they have time to write apps in time for a rumored December introduction of an HD TV set.
* Tim Cook yesterday said that the Apple TV set-top box remains “an experiment”, but also revealed a twofold increase in annualized sales this year as the company moved 2.7 million units in 2012 so far, nearly matching the 2.8 million units sold throughout last year.
* He also said Apple will “pulling the string” to see where the Apple TV goes.
* What do you guys think?
