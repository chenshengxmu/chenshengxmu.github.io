* The next year’s iPhone, let’s call it an ‘iPhone 7,’ is expected to be outfitted with three gigabytes of RAM, according to the revered analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities. If true, the iPhone 7 will pack in fifty percent more RAM than this year’s iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus that sport 2GB of RAM.
* According to Kuo’ note issue to clients Wednesday, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider, this will help the new phone multitask even better than the current iPhone 6s, which has doubled the amount of RAM relative to last year’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* The iPhone 7 is expected to run an Apple-designed ‘A10’ chip, reads the note. A JP Morgan analyst recently claimed that Apple already commissioned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) to build 100 percent of A10 orders, representing a major loss for rival Samsung.
* This year’s A9 and A9X processors are being built by both TSMC and Samsung. Last year’s A8 chips for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were exclusively built by TSMC. Kuo expects TSMC to be a sole supplier of A10 chips for the iPhone 7.
* The note goes on to predict that only the flagship 5.5-inch iPhone 7 will have 3GB of RAM while its 4.7-inch counterpart should carry 2GB of RAM like this year’s model. If true, this would represent Apple’s first attempt to differentiate between its iPhones in terms of RAM, not just battery capacity and optical image stabilization.
* Kuo did not share details regarding the iPhone 7’s exterior design. But if history is anything to go by it should feature an all-new enclosure and design because Apple introduces major exterior changes to the iPhone every two years. Kuo did say back in September that the iPhone 7 should measure iPod touch-thin at about 6.0-6.5mm.
