* Turning the page on another week, more wallpapers are celebrated as the week’s favorites. Keeping a fresh wallpaper supply is just as important as keeping clean socks ready at a moment’s notice. I change mine constantly, wallpapers that is, and am always scouring for a new image.
* Over the past week, Apple enthusiasts were excited to point out the iPhone turned seven. Sebastien, Jeff, and Cody even spoke about their experiences with the launch in Let’s Talk iOS podcast 011. In order to reminisce or show dedicated support for Apple, this week a small set of Apple logo wallpapers are ready for iPad and iPhone…
* I am always prideful with my Apple products and often use the wallpaper space to further show my brand loyalty. Using an Apple logo wallpaper makes sure you are not just showing off your connection on the backside of the product. Of course, the well designed and timeless Apple logo is always aesthetically pleasing at the same time. Below is a short list of simple and elegant Apple logo wallpapers, all of which are parallax ready.
* This week, as there are not multi variations, the full images are linked directly into the thumbnail.

* This week there is a little change in the download process. Tap the thumbnail image above for the full parallax resolution. Tap hold the full resolution image and save to Camera Roll. From either Photos.app or Settings.app set the image as wallpaper. From a desktop computer, right click and save the image to the iTunes sync folder.
* Per the usual request, submit your favorite images directly to me for consideration and posting on the site. It is easy to connect with me via Twitter @jim_gresham or email jim@idownloadblog.com. Make sure the images are dedicated for an iOS device, not simply a quick picture that you snapped with an iPhone. Parallax images are preferred, but not required. As a reminder, they do not need to be originals, just quality items.
* Happy iPhone birthday, everyone!
