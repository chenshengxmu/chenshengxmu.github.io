* iOS 8.1’s day has come and gone. Today, in fact, just a few minutes ago, Apple stopped signing the firmware.
* If you missed out on iOS 8.1, there is no way to either upgrade to it, or downgrade to it. Instead, you’ll have to go directly to iOS 8.1.1.
* Fortunately, like the firmware it replaces, iOS 8.1.1 is jailbreakable as well. Check inside to see what this means for the future of jailbreaking iOS.
* To check the signing status of iOS 8.1, visit IPSW.me/8.1. As you can see, there are red ‘!’ icons where the green check mark icons used to reside.
* Thankfully, this will have few impacts to those who wish to jailbreak, besides a few mild inconveniences. You can still upgrade to iOS 8.1.1 and use the TaiG tool for Windows to jailbreak iOS 8.1.1.
* Since iOS 8.2 beta appears to break the TaiG jailbreak, and since MuscleNerd said it was safe, I highly recommend that you go ahead and update to iOS 8.1.1 and jailbreak using the TaiG tool. If you’re already jailbroken on iOS 8.1, then that’s a personal decision with regard to choosing to stay put on iOS 8.1 or upgrade to iOS 8.1.1. If you’re not jailbroken and are currently on a non-jailbreakable firmware, then you have no choice but to upgrade to iOS 8.1.1 if you wish to jailbreak now.
* What do you think about Apple’s timing of the signing window closure? We pretty much figured it might happen today, since it’s been a while since iOS 8.1.1 was introduced. What about you?
