* Apple Watch is many things, but at its core, it is basically a very small, yet very powerful computer. And just like every computer out there, sometimes things don’t go the way you intend or expect them to. Apple Watch is definitely no exception.
* When or if your Apple Watch becomes unresponsive, there is a quick and easy way to get it back on track by simply performing a hard reset. In this post, we’ll show you how to force Apple Watch to restart.
* In order to hard reset your Apple Watch, simply press and hold the Digital Crown and the side button for about 10 seconds. After about 5 seconds, your screen will go black, but keep holding the buttons. Do not release them until you see the Apple logo on the watch screen.
* Once you see the Apple logo, your watch is successfully rebooting, and chances are any problem that caused you to force restart the device in the first place will be fixed.
