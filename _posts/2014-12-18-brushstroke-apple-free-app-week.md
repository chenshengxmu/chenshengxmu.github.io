* It’s Thursday and those of you who frequent iDB know what that means: Apple’s editors get to discount and highlight another app as part of the App Store’s ongoing promotion marketed under the ‘Free App of the Week’ banner.
* With last week’s free app, the popular retro-futuristic 3D shooter Space Qube, soon going back up to its regular price of three bucks, we now turn our attention to Brushstroke, a photography app available to you at no cost for a week.
* Created by Code Organa, the developer behind the amazing ToonCamera app which turns your video and photos into a live cartoon, Brushstroke transforms your photos into beautiful paintings in seconds. Brushstroke made its App Store debut back in March, has an average rating of 4.5 stars based on 285 reviews and was never free before.
* “Apply one of its many gorgeous filters, fine-tune to your heart’s content and add your digital signature,” the App Store editors wrote. “Once your masterpiece is complete, share it with your friends — or have it made into a real-life framed print through CanvasPop.”
* Brushstroke was updated earlier this week with a new illustration pack containing a few new styles, color palettes and canvases.

* The universal app is optimized for Apple’s 64-bit mobile chips and supports both the iPhone and iPad, including landscape mode support on the Apple tablet.
* It takes full advantage of iOS 8 and the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen resolutions, lets you move and scale your signature and crop your paintings and makes it real easy to adjust painting detail and color by swiping.
* Other features worth mentioning include manual exposure and camera control, undo/redo/reset, a range of different color palettes, a variety of canvases and surfaces and much more.
* The app is available free of charge and contains a one-time ‘Illustration Pack’ In-App Purchase priced at just 99 cents.
* The 23.1-megabyte download supports an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Download Brushstroke free of charge until next Thursday.
