* Amazon has finally updated its pretty great Kindle app for iPhone and iPad with support for the edge-to-edge OLED display panel powering your iPhone X’s Super Retina display.
* “We’ve added support for iPhone X, as well as several bug fixes and performance improvements,” Amazon wrote in release notes accompanying the app’s version 6.3 update.
* The new version also takes advantage of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 10.5 native resolution.
* The refreshed software now finally does away with the distracting horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of the interface that all non-optimized apps suffer from on iPhone X.
* It’s great that the app now takes full advantage of the native iPhone X resolution, but I find it ridiculous and distracting that it doesn’t hide the bottom bar like Apple’s iBooks does.
* Kindle for iOS received a major overhaul in October 2017, adding such enhancements as Goodreads integration, dark and light reading theme and other perks.
* Speaking of books, Apple is working on a major redesign for both the iBooks Store and the mobile iBooks app for iPhone and iPad (renamed as “Books” in iOS 11.3). It should adopt iOS 11’s App Store styling and provide dedicated Audiobooks and Reading Now sections.
* As for the iBooks Store, it’s said to gain new sections like Award Winners, Staff Picks and Rave Reviews. The redesign effort is reportedly led by Kashif Zafar, who was previously a senior vice president at Amazon-owned Audible, Bloomberg has reported.
* Since Apple and publishers lost the massive $450 million lawsuit from the US Department of Justice, we haven’t heard much in the way of iBooks so this is definitely a welcome change.
* Download Kindle for iOS from App Store.
