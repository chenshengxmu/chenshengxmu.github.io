* Aerial videographer Matthew Roberts posted new birds-eye footage of the upcoming Apple Park corporate campus, showing that a visitor center is slowly but surely takin shape.
* The historic Glendenning Barn that the company dismembered plank by plank has now been fully reassembled (itâ€™s adjacent to a 100,000-square-foot gym for employees).
* Among other highlights: a closer look at the 1,000-seat underground Steve Jobs Theater where Apple will host future press and corporate events, additional trees being planted and more.
* As for the visitor center, it will include an Apple Store and a cafe open to the public.
* As you can see for yourself, a pond inside the ring-shaped structure looks nearly complete. If the large sheet is an indication, Apple may soon fill the pond with water.
* Landscaping work will continue for a few months after the offices inside the main building have been completed. Since April, employees have been gradually moving into Apple Park.
