* The jailbreak community has been slower than usual following the new iPhone event just a couple of weeks ago, but that’s not to say jailbreak developers aren’t still brainstorming ways to improve iOS.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the new jailbreak tweaks released throughout the last week. We’ll start by showcasing our favorite tweaks, but we’ll get to all the rest afterward.

* SelfieTime is a new jailbreak tweak that brings facial smoothing to your iPhone’s front-facing camera during both selfies and FaceTime Video calls.
* Once installed, the tweak adds a toolbox to the native Camera app, letting you adjust the “beauty” level through four separate controls. It also includes an anti-mirror mode, which helps prevent your selfies from getting ‘flipped’ by the photography process.
* SelfieTime works best on newer devices because it can be resource-heavy, but the developer marked it as compatible with iPhone 5 and later running iOS 8.0 and later.
* You can learn more about what SelfieTime can do for you in our full review.

* iPhone Cam for iPad is a tweak that replaces the stock Camera app UI on the iPad with the one from the iPhone.
* If you’re familiar with the way the iPad’s Camera app looks, everything is placed along the sides of the app because it’s easier to reach that way. On the other hand, some people are more familiar with their iPhone’s Camera app interface, so they’d rather see something more familiar when opening the app.
* In addition to making the controls in the iPad’s Camera app more iPhone-like, the tweak also unlocks the live filter capability, which is usually disabled on iPads.
