* I’ve always found it rather peculiar that there is no native timer built into iOS’ stock Camera app, but leave it to the jailbreak community to come through with a solution.
* CamTime is a simple jailbreak tweak that places a timer directly to the left of the shutter button. It’s not the prettiest tweak in the world, but it can get the job done in a pinch.
* Tapping the time button results in a pop up dialogue that asks you to input the length of the timer in seconds. Once the time is entered, press okay, and the countdown will begin.
* CamTime works with both photos and video, depending on what mode you have the Camera app in upon starting the timer. Again, the tweak isn’t much in terms of looks, but it does work just as advertised.
* If you decide you’d like to take CamTime for a spin, then simply head over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo where you can download it free of charge. Be sure to let me know what you think about it in the comments below.
