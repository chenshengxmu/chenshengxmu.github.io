* Hot on the heels of the release of RedSn0w 0.9.9b9 and UltraSn0w 1.2.5, the Dev Team was quick at fixing a bug that affected iPhone 3GS owners with older bootrom. This fix comes with RedSn0w 0.9.9b9d which was released earlier today.
* If you have an iPhone 3GS with older bootrom and used RedSn0w 0.9.9b9, you can simply run this new version of RedSn0w on top of it…
* iPhone3GS owners in our comments section below noticed a problem with the untethered jailbreak available for the old-bootrom 3GS. We’ve corrected that problem in 0.9.9b9d. If you have an old-bootrom 3GS and have already used last night’s redsn0w on it, you can re-run it again without losing anything. Just use this new version, go to Extras->IPSW and manually select the 5.0.1 IPSW, then go back and Jailbreak it again (but you can uncheck Cydia because it’s already installed).
* You can find RedSn0w 0.9.9b9d from our downloads section. We also have a comprehensive RedSn0w tutorial, and of course, our dedicated RedSn0w page where you’ll learn just about everything you need about RedSn0w.
