* Apple on Thursday seeded the first beta of OS X 10.11.1 to developers. The new build is available to registered developers via the Updates section of the Mac App Store or through Apple’s Developer Center.
* The update, labeled build 15B17c, comes two weeks before the release of OS X El Capitan to the public. It’s similar to the approach we’ve seen on iOS, where the first iOS 9.1 beta arrived ahead of the iOS 9 launch.
* Much of El Capitan’s focus is on under-the-hood improvements, but there will some user-facing changes. These include a revamped Mission Control with new Split Screen mode, a new system-wide font and more.
* We’re not sure yet what kind of changes OS X 10.11.1 will bring, but it does appear to include support for Unicode 8. This means you’ll get to use those new emoji everyone is talking about like taco and middle finger.
