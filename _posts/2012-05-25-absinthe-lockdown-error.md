title: How to fix Absinthe Lockdown Error

* Even though Absinthe appears to be a very simple and stable jailbreak tool, a few people are still getting some errors despite the 2.0.1 update.
* The main errors that pop up seem to be “Error detecting device (lockdown error -5)” and “Could not connect to lockdown“…
* We’ve been in contact with @pod2g and @pimskeks, and they confirmed the problem is a random coincidence that creates a timeout. But the fix is fairly easy. All you have to do is go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Content and Settings. Then make sure you download Absinthe 2.0.1 and run it again.
* This should fix your problem. If not, or if you’re encountering a different error, please make sure to share with us.

* Thanks @FlawlessFox for the hookup
