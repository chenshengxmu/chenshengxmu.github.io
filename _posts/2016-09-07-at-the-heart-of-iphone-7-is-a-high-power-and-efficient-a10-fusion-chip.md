* Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are each powered by a powerful A10 Fusion system on a chip that is not only faster than any iPhone ever made, but also significantly more power efficient.
* It’s technically a quad-core processor, but two of those cores are high-performance cores and the other two are lower performance to handle power-efficient tasks in the background. It’s up to 40% faster than the A9 chip that came in the iPhone 6s and it’s up to twice as fast as the A8 chip that came in the iPhone 6.

* In addition to being faster, we mentioned efficiency. It literally only sips power, as Apple’s new custom performance controller makes it possible for the A10 Fusion chip’s low-power cores to use only 1/5 of the power of its high-power cores.

* The GPU inside of the A10 Fusion is also just as powerful. Gamers are going to love this: it’s a 6-core GPU with speeds up to 50% faster than the A9 chip from the iPhone 6s and 3x faster than the A8 chip in the iPhone 6. With it, games will render with an enjoyable buttery-smooth and high-FPS experience.

* The additional power efficiency reportedly gives the iPhone 7 up to two extra hours of battery life over the previous generation.
* A faster iPhone with more power and improved battery life is going to let those who love Pokémon GO go further than they ever have with their Pokémon adventures, of course, it helps in other areas too.
