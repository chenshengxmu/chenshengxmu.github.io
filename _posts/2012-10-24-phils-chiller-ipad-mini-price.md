* I have long insisted that Android people (lots of them, but not all) aren’t accustomed to pay for quality because Google envision Android as an ad-supported ecosystem, an extension of its business philosophy on the web. Some Apple fans were taken aback when Apple priced the iPad mini at $329 rather than $249 or even $199. While analysts believe the current price defends the iPad ecosystem from above and have no doubt the gizmo will be a smash hit, Apple’s head honcho of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller went on the record to defend the iPad mini’s price tag, here’s what came out of him…
* Speaking to Reuters, Schiller argued:
* The iPad is far and away the most successful product in its category. The most affordable product we’ve made so far was $399 and people were choosing that over those devices.
* And now you can get a device that’s even more affordable at $329 in this great new form, and I think a lot of customers are going to be very excited about that.
* Last year, over at 9to5Mac I opined about Android people reluctantly paying for quality.
* At $329, the iPad mini isn’t the Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire killer, but it does a great job at containing Google’s and Amazon’s attempts to take the iPad on the mid to high-end with tablets having displays measuring eight or more inches in diagonal.
* Schiller yesterday took a jab at Android by dedicating a significant portion of stage time to comparing scaled up apps on the Nexus 7 tablet to the 275,000 native iPad apps in the App Store, all of which work on the smaller iPad without any intervention on part of developers.

* “This isn’t just a shrunken down iPad”, said Schiller. “It’s an entirely new design.”
* Apple design guru Jony Ive echoes the sentiment in the iPad mini promo clip, saying the device represents a “concentration not a reduction”:
* Our goal was to take all the amazing things you could do with the full size iPad , and pack them into a product that is so much smaller. and that’s what we did with the iPad mini.
* If all that we had done was take the original iPad and just reduce it, all you would be aware of, was everything that was just missing.
* There is inherent loss in just reducing a product in size. And what we did was we went back to the very beginning. And we took the time to design a product that was a concentration of – not a reduction of – the original.
* Be that as it may, $329 is still $329.
* What do you think, did Apple price itself out of the market for tweener tablets with a $329 iPad mini?
