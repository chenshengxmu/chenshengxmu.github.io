* Apple’s launching an AppleCare+ plan that covers theft and loss. The plan is available for the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max for $299. Also for the first time, you can purchase an Apple+ plan on a monthly basis.
* With AppleCare+ for iPhone with Theft and Loss coverage, you’ll receive everything that’s included in the standard AppleCare+ for iPhone plan, plus extras. Here is how the two programs compare:
* AppleCare+ for iPhone covers up to two incidents of accidental damage coverage, each subject to the service fees, plus applicable tax. You’ll also get Express Replacement Service and 24/7 priority access to Apple experts by chat or phone. Under this plan, the screen damage deductible is $29, while accidental coverage is $99.
* AppleCare+ for iPhone with Theft and Loss includes up to two incidents of accidental damage, theft, or loss coverage, each subject to deductibles. You also receive Express Replacement Service and 24/7 priority access to Apple experts by chat or phone. With this type of coverage, you must have the Find My iPhone feature enabled on your device at the time it is lost or stolen.
* Under this plan, the screen damage deductible is $29, while accidental coverage is $99. When there are theft and losses involved, the deduction for both the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max is $269.
* Theft and Loss pricing for the iPhone Xr hasn’t been announced yet. However, Apple has said the protection is available for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 starting at $199.
* Monthly plans for AppleCare+ are available for up to 24 months and start at $10 for the standard program and $15 for theft and loss. If you elect to pay on a monthly basis, you should expect to pay between $40 and $60 more than if you paid for a plan upfront.
* In most countries, you can begin ordering an iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max on Friday, Sept. 14. The first shipments will arrive one week later on Friday, Sept. 21.
