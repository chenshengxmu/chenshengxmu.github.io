* Apple’s upcoming new headquarters, Campus 2 aka iSpaceship, has cleared the last remaining hurdle after the Cupertino City Council unanimously approved the project in November 2013. Apple has since started demolishing the site.
* Ron Cervi, news and traffic reporter for KCBS, has posted a nice-looking aerial photograph of the site on his Instagram profile, showing significant demolition progress being made…
* This latest image of the 176-acre parcel can be seen top of post. The photograph compares to a bunch of images of the site posted by MacRumors in December and included below.

* Apple purchased the parcel back in 2006. Hewlett-Packard’s campus remains hidden behind walls and the tree line. The main iSpaceship building will be located in the northern portion of the property.

* Apple will demolish all of the existing buildings to make room for the 2.8 million square foot ring-shaped glass and metal structure that will be a new home for approximately 12,000 Apple employees, many of them research and development people.

* The main building will occupy twenty percent of the landscape, with the remaining 80 percent being vegetated with more than 4,500 trees to “bring California back to Cupertino”.
* Underneath the building will be a massive parking facility capable of accommodating approximately 2,400 cars. Also underground: a beautiful auditorium structure depicted above and designed for corporate events. The auditorium will be a separate structure off the main circular glass structure.
* Apple is aiming to finish the first phase of the Apple Campus 2 construction by 2016. The structure is already $2 billion over budget.
