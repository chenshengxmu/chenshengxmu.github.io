* Multiple sources, including KK Leaks, OnLeaks and Benjamin Geskin, have tweeted out this claimed iPhone 8 schematic obtained from an unknown source. The alleged technical drawing may help cast light on some of the more prominently rumored features of the OLED-based device, namely wireless charging, a vertically aligned dual-lens camera on the back and—thankfully—no rear Touch ID. We cannot vouch for the legitimacy of the leaked diagram so you’re advised to approach this report with some skepticism.
* Showing the interior of the device, the drawing appears to match many recently leaked design schematics while hinting at the following rumored features of iPhone 8:
* Aside from these and other rumored features, iPhone 8 is said to use a 5.8-inch curved OLED screen packed into a casing roughly the size of a 4.7-inch iPhone.
* The device is widely expected to introduce an overhauled industrial design with all-glass front and back and a stainless steel frame holding the two sheets of glass together.
* An all-glass iPhone 8 would surely support wireless charging better than a metal one.

* As glass conducts heat quickly, iPhone 8 could adopt a thin graphite sheet to help dissipate heat when the phone is used with its optional wireless charging accessory.
* As for the lack of rear Touch ID, here’s some food for thought: what if Apple actually built Touch ID into iPhone 8’s elongated power button, shown on a dummy model below?

* At any rate, today’s schematic seems much more elaborate and legit than the ones we saw earlier, especially with no rear Touch ID and a wireless charging pad/coil on the back.
