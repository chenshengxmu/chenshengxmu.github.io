* Apple said yesterday that a software-development kit (SDK) for SAP Cloud Platform development is now available to iOS developers. Announced in May 2016, the Apple-SAP partnership aims to help reinvent business processes and workflows. The SDK lets developers build native iOS apps in Swift, Apple’s modern programming language, and integrate them with SAP’s Cloud Platform.
* For the uninitiated, SAP is a German business software maker that writes enterprise software for managing business operations and customer relations.
* The SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS lets developers build, extend and run iOS apps, powered by the SAP Cloud Platform and enterprise backend data. There are more than 2.5 million developers in the SAP community.
* A whopping 76 percent of business transactions touch an SAP system.

* Apple highlights these benefits:
* You can register for the SAP Academy for iOS on Apple’s website.
* SAP is currently building native iPhone and iPad apps for industries ranging from manufacturing to retail, designed to transform core work processes. The first of these, called SAP Project Companion, is planned for release today.
