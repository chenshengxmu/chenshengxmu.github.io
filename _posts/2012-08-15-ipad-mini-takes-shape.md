* After months of questions, Apple’s long-rumored iPad mini is finally starting to take shape. Multiple reports popped up last night detailing what the tablet may look like, and this morning, a purported headphone jack surfaced.
* The three write-ups that were released last night came from three different sources of Apple intel, but they all point to the same thing: a smaller iPad, with an iPod touch-thin profile, and smaller bezels on the sides of the display…
* The above mockup comes from the folks over at 9to5Mac, courtesy of designer Maurizio Vitale. For the most part, the rendering is based on these claimed iPad mini schematics that started circling the web last month. And given the details in last night’s reports, there’s a pretty good chance that they’re the real deal.

* Other than appearance, however, not much is known about the slate. It’ll likely carry the iPad 2’s 1024×768 display, and its front and rear cameras, but CPU and wireless connectivity (sans Wi-Fi) are still mysteries at this point.
* Apple is expected to unveil its smaller tablet alongside its new iPhone during next month’s media event. But with little evidence that the device is in production, it may not be available until late October or early November.
* So, what do you think of the iPad mini so far?
