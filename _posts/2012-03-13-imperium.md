* For most, the iPhone app switcher features enough options to get by. For jailbreakers? It’s a whole different story.
* Imperium is a jailbreak tweak that seeks to replace the App Switcher with OS X-like Mission Control inspired functionality in tow.
* If you consider yourself to be an iOS power user, then check inside to see whether or not Imperium will fit into your daily workflow…
* Imperium gives users the ability to set predefined app shortcuts, kill apps, toggle functions like Bluetooth, adjust brightness, and launch apps from a scrolling list of all of your installed apps.
* Imperium uses Activator, and features several settings to adjust the look and feel of the tweak.
* Imperium is now available on Cydia for the price of $0.99 on the BigBoss repo.
* What do you think?
