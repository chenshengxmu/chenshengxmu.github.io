* Ahead of Mobile World Congress, Samsung yesterday announced its new 5.5-inch Galaxy S9 and the 6.2-inch Galaxy S9 Plus smartphones features an 18.5:9 aspect ratio Infinity Display.
* These are Samsung’s official successors to last year’s Galaxy S8 lineup and the South Korean conglomerate’s first flagship smartphones in 2018.
* The new phones have retained Samsung’s praised industrial design of the previous generation and come in the usual stealthy black finish (called Midnight Black), plus Coral Blue, a new hue Lilac Purple and the internationally available Titanium Gray.

* In terms of speeds and feeds, US models run Qualcomm’s ten-nanometer Snapdragon 845 octa-core chip (four high-performance 2.7 GHz processing cores paired with four power-saving 1.7 GHz ones). Models sold in Europe and other international markets come outfitted with Samsung’s similarly specc’d homegrown Exynos processor.
* The smaller model uses 4GB of RAM and the Plus-sized Galaxy features 6GB of RAM. There’s a 3,000 mAh battery inside Galaxy S9 and a 3,500 mAh cell in the Plus model.
* Both devices include 64GB/128GB/256GB of onboard storage (expandable to 400GB via SD cards) and optically-stabilized, variable aperture cameras out the back. Galaxy S9 Plus features a dual-lens setup with a wide-angle 12-megapixel variable aperture sensor (F1.5/F2.4) paired with a 12-megapixel telephoto shooter with a fixed aperture (F2.4)
* Yes, these are actually your first smartphones in the world featuring a variable-aperture lens that’s capable of physically switching between a wide open aperture of F1.5 that lets huge amount of light in and the narrower F2.4 aperture for sharper-looking images.
* The new camera system can shoot slo-mo video in 1080p at 240 frames per second, just like iPhone X. However, it one-ups iPhone X with a brand new super slow-motion mode that shoots in 720p at a whopping 960 frames per second. It spreads 0.2 seconds of video to a longer six seconds, but doesn’t record audio and is limited to a 0.2-second capture session.

* To help people capture such a short fragment of time, Samsung’s Camera app has been redesigned (you now swipe between camera modes, like on iPhone) whilst gaining an automatic detection feature that looks for motion inside a user-defined square area, triggering a 0.2-second capture at 960 frames per second when sudden movement is detected.
* Other camera features include hardware-based noise reduction, enhanced HDR capabilities, object recognition (similar to Google Lens), the ability to live-translate signs and more.
* Samsung also brought out its version of Animoji, called AR Emoji.
* Using the eight-megapixel (F1.7) front-facing camera to capture the user’s facial muscle movement, it applies that data to various 3D characters. You can then send your creation as a GIF animation to other people, much like Animoji but with one major difference—the new Galaxies achieve AR Emoji without requiring infrared-based depth mapping.
* The shape of the new phones, their buttons and other external features are the same as on the previous-generation Galaxy S8 series. The rear-mounted fingerprint reader has been relocated beneath the camera, making it a tad easier to reach with your finger.
* It’s worth mentioning that the Galaxy S9 series supports additional biometric capabilities, like iris scanning and 2D facial recognition, with a new feature called Intelligent Scan automatically using the best biometric sensor for any given situation.
* The stereo speakers tuned by AKG are a bit louder than before (one is at the bottom of the phone and the other is in the earpiece, like with the iPhone 7/8/X series). This is also the first Samsung smartphone to support Dolby’s surround sound Atmos standard, something no Apple device supports out of the box.
* The latest Galaxies have retained several popular features from the Galaxy S8 series, such as USB-C, wireless charging (compatible with WPC and PMA), fast wired charging compatible with QC 2.0, Bluetooth 5.0, LTE Cat.18, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, IP68-rated water and dust resistance and—yes—the headphone jack.

* The new 5.8-inch Galaxy S9 (Quad HD+) and 6.2-inch Galaxy S9 Plus (Super AMOLED) smartphones are scheduled to go on sale on March 16, with pre-orders starting March 2. Galaxy S9 is priced at $720 and Galaxy S9 Plus at $840 in the United States.
