* Renowned RSS feed reading app, Reeder, is one of the best feed reading experiences on the Mac. And so I was quite happy when I learned that Reeder 3 was finally entering public beta.
* Reeder 3 will be a free update for Reeder 2 for Mac users. It comes with brand new themes and an OS X Yosemite-centric modern UI, among many other additions. Check out the full change log and download link in this post.

* I know I’ve tended to rag on Reeder developer Silvio Rizzi in the past for taking so long to push updates, but that’s because I consider Reeder to be the best feed reading experience money can buy. It’s not perfect—there’s STILL NO SEARCH which is downright baffling to me—but I can live with that.
* Here are the release notes for Reeder 3.0 beta 1:

* You can download Reeder 3.0 beta 1 by visiting this link.
* I stopped using Reeder because of its lack of updates, but now that the public beta is out for Reeder 3.0, I’m back on the wagon.
* Do you still use RSS in your daily routine? If so, which app do you use to keep up with your feeds?
