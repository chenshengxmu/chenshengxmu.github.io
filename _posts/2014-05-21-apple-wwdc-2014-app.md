* Apple’s free WWDC app for iOS has been updated with relevant 2014 conference schedule and related content ahead of its upcoming developer-only event.
* The 5-day Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off with a keynote on June 2 and will give us previews of iOS 8 code-named Okemo and OS X 10.10, code-named Syrah after a wine.
* Version 2.0 of the WWDC app for the iPhone and iPad includes a brand new icon, a revamped design with an aesthetically pleasing orange theme and, more importantly, content support for the upcoming event. If you’re not attending WWDC, the app is a nice way to follow the announcements as they happen, watch session videos uploaded throughout the week, browse floor plans and more…
* “Download this update to get all the latest news and information for WWDC 2014 as it’s posted,” notes Apple in iTunes release notes accompanying the 5MB binary.
* The new Home screen app icon looks nice.

* As you can see on the screenshots top of post, there’s indeed a 10:00PM – 12:00 PM slot reserved for a keynote on Monday, June 2. Aside from iOS 8 and OS X 10.10, we don’t anticipate a new Apple TV, iWatch or other hardware announcements at the event.
* On the content side, however, Apple should share interesting developments. In light of recent rumors of Apple’s purported $3.2 billion Beats buy, company co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre are believed to see their grand introductions as company executives at the five-day conference.
* I’m loving the new orange theme.

* The event agenda includes the interesting new Women In Technology and Apps for China sessions.
* On Women In Technology:
* Celebrate the increased participation of women in technology. Join like-minded peers, industry leaders and others to discuss technology education for girls, workplace training, mentoring, diversity and inclusion, male advocacy, entrepreneurship and more.
* Be prepared to share your experiences and ideas, get inspired and help motivate others.
* And this on the Apps for China event:
* With more and more iPhones, iPads and Macs in China everyday, there’s a huge business opportunity for apps in this region. Meet developers who’ve brought their app to China, talk with Chinese developers about their experience, culture and language, discussing marketing apps in China, talk to people about getting an app approved for China and make new friends with other developers and Apple experts who know or want to know more about this topic.
* Discuss localization and meet people who localize apps, see and show some of the most popular apps in China, exchange ideas about how best to support Chinese speakers and get motivated by all of the opportunities that exist for China games, educational app and business apps.
* The app shows a number of secret sessions with funny remarks as ‘This is Still Under Wraps’, ‘All In Due Time,’ ‘No Comment Yet’, ‘We’re Not Telling Just Yet’ and more.
