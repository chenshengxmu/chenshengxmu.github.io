* Earlier today, we started receiving reports that folks were having issues with their Weather app after jailbreaking. It’s been the one glitch in an otherwise flawless execution of the evasi0n tool.
* The issue appears to be limited to iPhones—the iPad actually gains Weather app functionality—and is only affecting some users. But nevertheless, the brilliant evad3rs say they’re on it…
* Both pod2g and MuscleNerd of the evad3rs hacking team commented on the bug this afternoon, saying that they have—or more specifically planetbeing has— already begun working on a fix for it.
* We are currently investigating the weather app problem. A fix will popup on cydia when the problem is understood.

* For those seeing the Weather app problem, @planetbeing has started working on a fix.Until then, just don’t go outside.

* We assume we’ll see a patch pop up in Cydia sometime in the next couple of days that will fix the Weather bug. Until then you can either stay inside, as MuscleNerd suggests, or try restoring and re-jailbreaking.
* Obviously, we’ll let you know as soon as this matter gets resolved.
