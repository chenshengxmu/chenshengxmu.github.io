* Less than 48 hours after seeding its developers with the second OS X 10.11.2 El Capitan beta, Apple today made OS X 10.11.2 beta 2 available to public beta testers.
* People who are running a previous El Capitan beta on their Mac can apply the update through the Mac App Store’s Purchased tab, or download the standalone installer through Apple’s portal for developers. You must be a member of the Apple Beta Software Program to use this pre-release software.
* You can apply for Apple’s Beta Software Program with your Apple ID here without being a developer. Membership in this program will give you complete access to public betas of both iOS and OS X, completely free of charge.
* The second beta of OS X 10.11.2 does not bring out any new user-facing features as Apple asks developers to focus on any remaining issues with graphics, Mail, Wi-Fi, Calendar, USB, Notes, Photos, Spotlight and networking.
* When it’s released for public consumption, the free of charge OS X El Capitan 10.11.2 update will improves the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac.
* If you’re signed on Apple’s beta-testing program, you might want to take iOS 9.2 beta 2 for a spin on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. The second beta of iOS 9.2 brings a new AT&T Wi-Fi Calling feature (based on the carrier’s NumberSync technology) to your Mac with OS X 10.11.2 beta 2.
