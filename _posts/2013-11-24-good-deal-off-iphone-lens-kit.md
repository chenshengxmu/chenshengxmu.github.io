* Looking for something special to get that someone special in your life for the holidays? Well if they’re an iPhone 5/5s user and like taking photos, we may have just the thing for you: a 4 piece iPhone lens kit.
* The kit includes an 8x telephoto lens with custom snap-on mounting case, a fisheye lens, a macro/wide angle lens, and a 2x telephoto lens. And for a limited time, Stack Social is taking 62% off the bundle’s usual price…
* Here’s the description from Stack Social:
* “Whether we’re snapping photos at a party, on the beach by our office, or just around LA, having these lenses in our back pockets (literally) gives us the ability to adapt to any photo opportunity. And with magnetic “snap-on, snap-off” functionality, you can store the others in your pocket till you need them.
* The wide angle and macro lens can be used together, or you can unscrew the wide angle lens and take high detail, close up shots with just the macro lens.”
* And here’s a list of what you’ll get in the box:
* And finally, a few sample shots for good measure:
* Macro Lens

* Wide Angle Lens

* Bazaared typically sells this bundle for $129, but for the next 12 days (as of 11/24/2013), you can pick it up at Stack Social for $49. That’s roughly $80 off, and still $20 than what olloclip sells its popular 4-in-1 lens kit for.
* There’s no refunds on the deal, but it does come with a 90-day warranty from the manufacturer. Also, shipping is included in the above price to the US and several other countries. For more information, click here.
