* Apple may be on the end of bad press regarding its manufacturing processes of late, but it is set to bring thousands of new jobs to the United states and more specifically, in Austin, Texas.
* The state announced today that Apple plans to invest $304 million to bring around 3,600 jobs to the area as part of the expansion of its existing facilities there.
* The news will possibly go some way to improving the iPad maker’s reputation, with news of poor working conditions in Chinese factories causing more than a few headaches for those in Cupertino…
* “The new campus will more than double the size of Apple’s workforce in Texas over the next decade, supporting the company’s growing operations in the Americas with expanded customer support, sales and accounting functions for the region. In exchange for Apple’s commitment to create these new jobs in Texas, the state has offered Apple an investment of $21 million over ten years through the Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF).”
* Apple’s work in Texas mainly revolves around customer support and similar administration-related business, though chip design and other tech-based work does go on in the state also.
