* Apple has launched its Back to School promotion in Australia and New Zealand ahead of the new school year. The promotion is open to students, parents and staff members of K-12 or higher education schools and requires an eligible purchase be made between January 15 and April 1. Akin to the company’s Back to School promotion in the US and Europe last June, students in Australia and New Zealand who purchase a 9.7-inch iPad with Retina display will get a free AU$50 (NZ$65) Student Gift Card. Some notable Macs are also eligible…
* All Macs (the iMac, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air or Mac Pro), save for the Mac mini, are part of this promotion and Apple will throw an AU$100 (NZ$125) Student Gift Card with any Mac purchase. Refurbished Macs are eligible too, but not refurbished iOS devices.
* The Student Gift Cards can be redeemed to buy software, music, movies, electronic books and other items Apple sells on iTunes.
* MacStories, which first reported on Apple’s Back to School in Australia and New Zealand, notes that Apple on its online store has also put together a list of top Mac and iOS apps that might appeal to students and a buying guide that includes various accessories, bags and software for students.
* Have you ever taken advantage of Apple’s Back to School?
