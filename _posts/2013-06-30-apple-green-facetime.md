* Here we are, nearly 3 weeks after Apple took the wraps off of iOS 7, and folks are still talking about the drastic redesign. The overall consensus seems to be that most people like it, but many are hoping that Apple will do some serious fine-tuning before its public release this fall.
* In fact, rumor has it that the software isn’t nearly as far along as previous versions have been in their initial betas. So even the folks that are unhappy with iOS 7’s current state are optimistic that it will see big changes. But if this new trademark filing is any indication, it won’t…
* PatentlyApple reports:
* “Today, the US Patent & Trademark Office published Apple’s latest trademark filing for their redesigned “FaceTime” logo. Apple originally filed for the new design earlier in the week. Due to Apple’s redesigned iOS 7 UI going flat, many icons will have to be updated with the US Patent and Trademark Office in the coming months.”
* Of course, companies trademark logos all of the time, so the move isn’t surprising. And just as PatentlyApple points out, we imagine we’ll be seeing Apple filing for a number of trademarks with the US Patent & Trademark Office for its new iOS 7 icons over the coming weeks/months.
* After countless rumors that Jony Ive was heading up a major iOS redesign, Tim Cook and company unveiled iOS 7 during Apple’s WWDC keynote earlier this month. On top of the addition of several new features, the entire UI has been changed, including stock iOS apps and icons.
* Apple seeded the second beta of iOS 7 to developers last week. The update included iPad support, new messaging and Siri features, the readdition of the stock Voice Memos application, and a slew of other improvements. And the word is that the third beta could land as soon as July 8.
