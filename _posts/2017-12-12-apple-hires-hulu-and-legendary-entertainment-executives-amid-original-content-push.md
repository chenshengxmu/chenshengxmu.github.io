* Apple continues its Hollywood hiring spree with news that it’s enlisted managerial talents of Hulu and Legendary executives as it seeks to boost its original content production.
* Variety reported Tuesday that Hulu’s Philip Matthys and Legendary’s Jennifer Wang are joining the Cupertino technology giant’s Los Angeles-based worldwide video group.
* Matthys, who was Hulu’s dealmaker and worked on “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Marvel’s Runaways” and “Castle Rock,” started at Apple last month as the head of business affairs.
* Grazier has been EVP of Business and Legal Affairs for Legendary Entertainment for two years, but her work experience also includes the likes of Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.
* She will start at Apple in January 2018.
* As for Grazier, she will report to Matthys who reports to Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht. Amburg and Elricht are former high-ranking Sony Television executives that the iPhone maker hired in the summer to lead its video programming unit.
* This comes just as we’ve learned that programming veteran Michelle Lee joined Apple’s venture into scripted television content as a creative executive at Apple Worldwide Video.
* Lee will report to Matt Cherniss, who joined Apple in August.
* Apple’s scripted TV efforts include a network morning-show drama starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and a revival of Steven Spielberg’s anthology series “Amazing Stories.”
