* Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, the principal Apple Watch manufacturer, is experiencing what could only be described as extremely low defect-free rate of less than thirty percent as it continues to struggle with low yield issues.
* And in order to help solve purported manufacturing issues, Quanta has enlisted help of three-thousand workers from Foxconn to improve the yield rate, according to G for Games Thursday citing Taiwanese media.
* Why would Quanta borrow workers from rival Foxconn. Well, market sources believe Foxconn is more likely to be another Apple Watch assembly firm than Inventec.
* It’s unclear if the low defect-free rate will affect Apple Watch shipments, which will commence on April 24. Apple is set to kick off pre-orders for the device on April 10 and the publication has speculated that an unusually wide one-month window between the March 9 “Spring Forward” announcement and April 10 pre-orders to give its contract manufacturers ample time to solve the yield issue.

* It should be noted that Quanta began mass production of the device back in January. It would be very atypical of Apple to hold a second media event and formally announce pre-order and shipping dates whilst its contract fabricators were coping with really bad defect-free rates.
* Hopefully this sketchy rumor doesn’t hold a grain of truth. I’m taking this one with a few pinches of salt for the time being.
