* Multi-page editorial coverage of the Apple Watch in the world’s top fashion magazines continues with a new cover appearance and multi-page spread in Hong Kong street fashion and lifestyle magazine East Touch this month, Hype Beast reported Monday.
* In addition, the wrist-worn device has appeared on the cover and a two-page spread inside the Big Spring issue of London-based fashion mag Style.
* As pictured above and below, young male hipster-styled models can be see wearing the Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch versions, featuring different straps and watch faces.

* Interestingly enough, the inside feature mentions the “Apple Watch Sport with 38mm Space Grey aluminum case and black band” costing $349.
* This contradicts Apple pundit John Gruber who speculated that the space grey Apple Watch Sport and the space black stainless steel Apple Watch models may end up costing more than the baseline $349 price.
* Noting that Apple’s device will “wipe the floor with existing smartwatch manufacturers and give mid-market watchmakers a fright,” the featured story lavishes praise on Apple’s design czar Jony Ive who led the Watch project.
* “Jony Ive has got the tone of the Apple Watch just right,” reads the story.
* “It looks elegant but not standoffish, and as well as the 18 variations of the regular version, there are the 10 Sport options, which come with a lightweight case, strengthened glass and a rubber strap, plus the more expensive Edition range (six models), made from 18ct gold.”
* Editorial features in the world’s top fashion and lifestyle magazines are part of a marketing campaign leading up to the Apple Watch launch in April.
* Past examples include Self magazine which dedicated its March cover to the device, with supermodel and Victoria’s Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel wearing an Apple Watch Sport model on photographs.
* Similarly, the March issue of the Vogue magazine sports a multi-spread feature containing actual-size photographs of the wrist-clad device, while the magazine’s digital edition features a video ad showcasing the device.

* And back in November 2014, Vogue China ran a cover story featuring the 18-karat yellow gold Apple Watch Edition.
* Apple is expected to share more information about the wrist-worn device at its “Spring Forward” media event on March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.
* Stay tuned as iDownloadBlog will be providing live coverage of the event.
