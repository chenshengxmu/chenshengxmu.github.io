* PlugBug World, Twelve South’s versatile hybrid charger for your Mac, iPhone, iPad and other USB-charged devices that connects to any MacBook brick or Apple’s USB wall charger, is getting even better. Today, the premium Apple accessory maker announced PlugBug Duo, a cool update to the charming red plug that brings an additional 12-watt USB port for charging.
* PlugBug World is one of Twelve South’s most popular products ever.
* Highlights:
* “You’ve got the new MacBook Pro and all the USB-C ports you could ever need. Unfortunately the problem is that most of your gear—wireless headphones, battery packs, iPad, Magic Mouse, etc—still charge with the old USB,” the pitch goes.
* As mentioned, PlugBug Duo lets you charge two additional devices from your standard MacBook charger (like an iPhone and your iPad, or Apple Watch) at a total 12 watts of power. That’s more than twice as fast as that 5-watt charger your iPhone came with. And at 2.1A, the accessory lets you also charge your iPad or iPhone faster than normal.

* You can do this simultaneously with the new PlugBug Duo
* Aside from the added port, the Duo ships with the same 5 international adapters included with PlugBug World so you can charge your devices in more than 150 countries around the world.
* To be clear, nothing has changed in terms of core functionality.
* As I mentioned in my detailed review of the original PlugBug World accessory, this is a charger that Apple should have made, but obviously didn’t. The thing clips onto your MacBook charger pin. Drawing power from it, this lets you top u any iOS device while feeding power to your notebook at the same time, reducing cable clutter and improving efficiency.

* And with the Duo, you can now charge two USB devices and your MacBook simultaneously from a single outlet, perfect for crowded airports, coffee shops or anywhere you travel.
* This is slowly but surely becoming a USB-C world.
* I asked West Cerrudo, Twelve South’s Director of Marketing, to comment on the fact that PlugBugDuo incorporates the ubiquitous USB-A ports rather than USB-C ones for charging. In short, she said, this is by design because PlugBug Duo was meant to be a USB-based charging accessory from the onset.

* “We of course understand that many of our favorite devices will be moving into the USB-C world in the near future but that still leaves us with everything we currently own charging with USB-A,” he said, adding, “not to mention all our other peripherals including wireless headphones, external battery packs and all your current iOS devices.”
* There you have it.
* The new PlugBug Duo is a $49.99 purchase from the Twelve South webstore or Amazon. The previous-generation PlugBug World is now available for $30 on Amazon, down from $45.
* Twelve South is no longer making PlugBug World so be sure to pick up yours from Amazon, if you’re interested, while supplies last.
* What are your thoughts and feelings on PlugBug Duo?
