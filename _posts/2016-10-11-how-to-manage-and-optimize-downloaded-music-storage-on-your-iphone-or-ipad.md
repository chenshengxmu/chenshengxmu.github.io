* Subscribed to Apple Music? If so, you probably download a bunch of songs to your iOS device so you can listen to your favorite tunes on the go, without an Internet connection. Of course, offline music cache takes up your device’s precious storage and some folks forget that they’ve downloaded songs in the first place.
* You can, of course, manually remove any offline tracks stored on the device or have iOS limit music storage on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch—just like on the Apple Watch. This tutorial will teach you how to manage music storage on your iOS device, manually delete offline songs, change settings to your liking and more.
* You can download any song, album or playlist for offline listening by tapping the cloud icon next to its name in the Music app, but keep in mind that iCloud Music Library must be enabled in Settings → Music → iCloud Music Library.
* To see the download progress, tap Library in the tab area alongside the bottom, then choose Downloaded Music → Downloading.
* If your iPhone or iPad is low on storage space, why not tell iOS to automatically free up some space by removing any downloaded music that you haven’t played in a while?
* 1) Go to Settings → Music → Optimize Storage.
* 2) Now choose a minimum amount of storage on your device that you want to dedicate to storing downloaded music files for offline listening.

* Dedicating a minimum of four gigabytes of storage lets you keep about 800 high-quality offline tracks on the device. By comparison, 32 gigabytes of dedicated music storage lets you keep about 6,400 downloaded songs on the device.
* The lower minimum storage you choose, the more usable storage space you will have for apps, photos and other things. If you’d rather iOS use whatever amount of storage space is available for keeping offline music, choose None instead.

* To prevent iOS from automatically managing your music storage and removing downloaded tracks as needed, slide the Optimize Storage switch to the OFF position.

* With the feature disabled, you’ll need to manually delete any downloaded music when your iPhone or iPad is low on space.
* To delete a downloaded song, album, playlist or music video from the device, tap it in the Music app and hit Remove, then select Remove Downloads.

* On 3D Touch devices, simply press a song or album, then select the Remove option. Any removed offline songs remain in your iCloud Music Library.

* You can also remove all songs or certain artists from your device in the Settings app: go to Settings → Music → Downloaded Music and tap the Edit button.

* Now hit the red minus sign next to All Songs to remove all downloaded music or slide the artists whose music you wish to delete, then tap Delete.
* Tap Done to finish deleting your downloaded music.
* And now, my final piece of advice to you: to stop your iPhone or iPad from automatically downloading music for offline listening whenever you add songs, albums and playlists to your library, toggle the Automatic Downloads switch in Settings → Music.
* If you think this tutorial will be useful to others, please pass it along to your friends, family or anyone who you think might find it useful.
