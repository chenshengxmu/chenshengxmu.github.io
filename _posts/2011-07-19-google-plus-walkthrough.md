* Google just released its official Google+ app for the iPhone in the App Store. The app is available for free, and it allows you to interact and keep up with your Google+ account on the go.
* We’ve put together a review and walkthrough of Google+ for iPhone in screenshots. Check out everything about the app below!
* Overall, the Google+ seems to need some work. It’s a little buggy, and it can tend to crash. On iOS 5, it crashes almost every 30 seconds.
* The Google+ app does not support the iPad or iPod touch, which is a weird move on Google’s part. Readers have also noted that the app currently seems to not be available in many countries outside the US.
* Besides the app’s reliability, Google seems to have done a good job with the clean UI and feature set. There’s nothing too overwhelming about the Google+ app, and it ties in with the social network’s features pretty well. You can view and interact with your stream like you would expect, and manage your circles and profile.
* Some cool iPhone-specific features include the ability to check into a location (like Facebook Places), add location data to your posts, and share photos from your iPhone. Video sharing doesn’t seem to be supported.
* While I did notice a few crashes when playing with it, I wouldn’t call the Google+ app a failure. There are redeeming qualities to the app, and it definitely fills a huge void of there needing to be a Google+ app in the App Store. It will be interesting to see what third party clients come out for Google+ in the future.
* Google+ for iPhone is available for free in the App Store. We’ve collected a detailed walkthrough of the app in screenshots for you to check out below. Let us know your impressions of the app in the comments!
