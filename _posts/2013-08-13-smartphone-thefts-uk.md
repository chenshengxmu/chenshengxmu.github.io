* The issue over smartphone thefts has taken on a British flavor. London’s mayor now says he supports calls by American law enforcement officials asking Apple and others to beef up ways to prevent stolen phones.
* In a statement, London Mayor Boris Johnson said smartphone makers should “take this issue seriously.” Already, a half-dozen American officials have joined the ‘Secure Our Smartphones’ campaign, stretching from Hawaii to Delaware…
* “Residents and visitors to our city need better protection from the menace of smartphone theft,” Johnson said last week, according to AllThingsD.
* We need the industry to take this issue seriously and come up with a technical solution that can squash the illegal smartphone market that is fueling this crime.
* San Francisco District Attorney General George Gascón and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman held a summit in June, inviting Apple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft to discuss what they are doing to use technology to stem the rise of smartphone-related crimes.

* The San Francisco crime fighter, who has pushed for a physical “kill switch” came away from the meeting pleased. Apple is adding an Activation Lock feature to iOS 7 which prevents a carrier activation even after a thief has disabled Find My iPhone or performed a full reset of the device.
* Samsung isn’t standing still either. The South Korean company is working with Absolute Software to include an anti-theft measure in the Galaxy S4, powered by Google’s Android mobile software.
* Do you think Apple is doing enough to prevent smartphone theft?
* And what other features, if any, the company should introduce to make its devices more secure?
