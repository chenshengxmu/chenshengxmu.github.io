* Apple’s upcoming iPad Pro will feature a 12.2-inch display, and be nearly as thin as an iPhone 6 (6.9mm), according to a new report from Macotakara. Citing reliable sources, the Japanese outlet says the device will also contain stereo speakers, and a microphone, on both its top and bottom edges.
* Additionally, the outlet claims that the design of the device is largely based on the iPad Air 2, and it has provided a rough sketch of the tablet, which you can see above. There’s not much to the illustration, but there does seem to be a row of what looks like speaker holes across the device’s top bezel.
* The larger iPad has been bouncing around the Apple rumor mill for several months now, but this is the first time we’ve heard of the extra speakers and the 12.2-inch display—previous reports have pointed to 12.9-inch. Macotakara has certainly been wrong before, but it has a fairly solid track record.
* It’s believed Apple wanted to launch the so-called iPad Pro this fall, but due to complexities in the project and resource demand for the new iPhones, it was forced to push it back until early 2015. The tablet is expected to focus on productivity, aiming at the Microsoft Surface Pro and similar devices.
