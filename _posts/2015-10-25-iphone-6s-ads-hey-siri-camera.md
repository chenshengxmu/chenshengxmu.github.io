* Less than two weeks following its iPhone 6s commercial that focused on 3D Touch, Apple’s begun rolling some new ads for the handset.
* Adopting the dynamic and to-the-point format inaugurated by the previous ad, a trio of new commercials—titled “Crush,” “The Camera” and “Flip a Coin” and all starring actor and singer Jamie Foxx—showcase other iPhone 6s capabilities, like hands-free ‘Hey Siri’ and a variety of camera features.
* Here we have Jamie Foxx tying a tie in front of a mirror and asking Siri, hands-free of course, to opine on his looks, to which she replies…
* Well, just watch the ad and see what happens next for yourself.

* “The iPhone 6s is here, and the only thing that’s changed with Siri is everything,” explains Apple. “Because now you just say ‘Hey Siri’ and Siri’s there, hands-free. Which can come in handy.”
* This one’s about one of Siri’s crowd-pleaser tricks: flipping a coin (go ahead, ask Siri yourself to flip a coin). It bears the same YouTube description as the Crush commercial.

* And the last one details the biggest iPhone camera upgrade ever by going through such features as Live Photos, Retina Flash, 4K video capture, Slow-Mo in HD and more.

* “The iPhone 6s is here and the only thing that’s changed with camera is everything,“ reads the video description.
* How do you like the new commercial and which one’s your favorite? I find Foxx appropriately casted to make the ads instantly recognizable and memorable.
* And the more I’m watching these ads, the more I think that the “The only thing that’s changed is everything” tagline is incredibly sticky.
