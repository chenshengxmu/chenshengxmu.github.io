title: This tweak makes the App Switcher's Home screen card more consistent

* The App Switcher has a Home screen card in addition to those for each of your recently used apps. While each app has its own header with an icon and label above it, the Home screen card unfortunately does not.
* A new free jailbreak tweak called HomeCardIconLabel by iOS developer DGh0st does away with this inconsistency and adds both a label and icon to the top of the Home screen card in the App Switcher.
* As shown above, the tweak makes a subtle impact on the ‘completeness’ of the stock UI without going over the top. The small icon and the label are exactly the same size as those above all the rest of your App Switcher cards and it looks great:

* HomeCardIconLabel is purely an aesthetic add-on, so with that regard, it comes down to personal preference in terms of whether to install the tweak; no functional gains are achieved with the tweak.
* If you like the way HomeCardIconLabel looks, you can pick it up for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak is intended to work on jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices only.
* Do you like the look of the App Switcher with or without the additional label for the Home screen? Share in the comments section below.
