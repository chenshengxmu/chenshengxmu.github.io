* The Taptic Engine inside new iPhones has replaced tiny rotary vibrators found on prior iPhone models (iPod touches and iPads lack a vibrator motor of their own).
* Its primary function, however, has remained unchanged: to provide optional vibratory alerts when a phone call or a notification comes in, depending on the state of Vibrate on Ring and Vibrate on Silent switches in Settings → Sounds.
* Prior to iOS 9, you couldn’t turn off vibration completely for things like emergency alerts. But starting with iOS 9, there’s a new master switch to turn off all vibration on your device.
* In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to disable all vibration on your iPhone, including those for various emergency alerts, with just a few quick taps.
* Step 1: Launch Settings on your iPhone.
* Step 2: Go to the General → Accessibility section.
* Step 3: Tap on Vibration in the section following options under the Interaction heading.
* Step 4: Flip the Vibration switch to the OFF position.

* “When this switch is off, all vibration on your iPhone will be disabled, including those for earthquake, tsunami and other emergency alerts,” reads the feature’s description.
* Again, this master switch overrides vibration settings in Settings → Sounds.
