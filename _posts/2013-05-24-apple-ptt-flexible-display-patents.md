* Among the more than two-dozen patents granted to Apple by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office earlier this week is one hinting the iPhone maker could finally enter the Push-to-Talk (PTT) arena and another one indicating the firm may breathe new life into its rumored plans for wearable devices.
* The PTT patent likely is the result of a $4.5 million purchase by Apple and others of a portfolio of intellectual property sold by Nortel Networks in 2011. Meanwhile, the USPTO granted Apple a patent on flexible touch panels which could potentially be used for even smaller devices, such as the much-rumored iWatch…
* Direct conversations between iPhone users has been a concept that’s attracted the attention of both consumers and Apple. The patent granted Tuesday covers a “method and system to provide push-to-talk from one user to another, in a wireless packet data telecommunications network.”
* Shortly after Apple reportedly began investigating PTT, the company was among a group of firms which in 2011 purchased a number of patents sold by Canada’s Nortel.
* In that portfolio was a 2001 patent filing describing a ‘Push-to-Talk Telecommunications System Utilizing a Voice-Over-IP Network.’

* In another curious patent granted Apple, the Cupertino company describes a “double-sided touch sensitive panel and flex circuit bonding.”
* The patent application notes “two flex circuits connect to directly opposing sides of the sensor panel” making the “overall size of the sensor panel as small as possible.”
* More uncertain is just what plans – if any – Apple has for this invention.
* “This technology would go toward Apple’s continual push to make each of its devices thinner than the previous generation,” supposes AppleInsider.
* Indeed, numerous reports point to Apple’s work in advancing wearable technology, the most notable example being Apple’s rumored iWatch.
* Other Apple patents have hinted at curved batteries and flexible touchpad displays, while other third-parties have already released wearable technology products designed as bracelets.
