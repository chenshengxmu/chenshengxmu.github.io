* The Dev Team just released RedSn0w 0.9.6b2, a new version of their famous jailbreak tool for Mac and Windows. What’s new in RedSn0w 0.9.6b2? The most interesting news is that RedSn0w will now jailbreak all devices on iOS 4.1: iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPad, iPod Touch 3G, iPod Touch 4G, and Apple TV.
* Also new is the ability to have custom bootlogos on the iPhone 3G/3GS and iPod Touch 2G. Perhaps the most interesting new feature is the option that implements the DFU button in PwnageTool…
* You can now cook a custom firmware on a Mac using PwnageTool and install it via RedSn0w by choosing the “Just enter pwned DFU mode right now” option.
* For those of you who about an unlock, you should either stay away from RedSn0w and use PwnageTool, or wait for an unlock which should come sooner than later.
* You can download RedSn0w 0.9.6b2 from our iPhone downloads section. For step by step instructions on how to use RedSn0w, please refer to our Mac tutorial or our PC guide.
