* As iPhone 4S units start arriving across the globe this week, expect to see several head-to-head comparison videos with top competitors. Some critics believe that the latest iPhone doesn’t measure up to the competition, so it’s time to find out for sure.
* Slashgear is one of the first to the party, as the site has obtained a Verizon-flavored version of Apple’s new handset. And with a T-Mobile-branded Samsung Galaxy S II laying around, they decided to pit the two smartphones against each other in a web test…
* After soundly beating its predecessor in a few head-to-head website-loading tests, Slashgear puts the iPhone 4S up against Android’s best — the Galaxy S II. With its dual-core 1.5GHz processor, the new Galaxy S is one of the fastest phones in the business.
* Here’s Slashgear on the results:
* “One of the fastest processor around currently, the 1.5 GHz Qualcomm in the Galaxy S II performs very well but is just barely by a hair beat by the new A5 dual-core iPhone 4S in most tests. We could argue about this all day, or try other sites but when it really comes down to it iOS is highly efficient — not to mention many websites are designed with iOS in mind.”
* The test seems to be on even grounds as the browser cache is cleared from both devices, and they’re both on Wi-Fi. It’s interesting to see that the iPhone 4S outpaces the flagship Android handset, but as Slashgear suggests, it could be iOS-related.
* What do you think of the results of the web test?
