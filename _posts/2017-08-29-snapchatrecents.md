* If you’ve got a lot of friends in Snapchat and you find it challenging to keep up with everyone’s snaps, then a new free jailbreak tweak called SnapchatRecents by iOS developer NeinZedd9 could help.
* This tweak helps prevent you from forgetting to respond to your friends in Snapchat by using a couple of pressuring tactics to get you to answer them more quickly.
* The first major feature SnapchatRecents brings to the table is displaying a clock Emoji next to all snaps received within 24 hours, as shown above. This lets you know which Snapchats you opened recently, letting you know to reply to them as soon as possible rather than leaving the person to see that you’ve “read” their Snapchat without replying.
* After 24 hours pass and a snap begins to age, the clock Emoji disappears, giving priority to those that just came in recently instead.
* Another subtle way the tweak reminds you to take care of business is by moving these snaps to the top of your Recents list in the app, which helps you prioritize those that are waiting on you.
* SnapchatRecents seems like it takes advantage of useful methods to help you manage your snap workflow better. Moreover, it can help prevent you from getting those awkward messages from friends that go something like, “Hey, why didn’t you reply to my snap yet?”
* If you feel like you could use a little push in keeping your incoming snaps organized, you can download SnapchatRecents for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 10 devices with the free Snapchat app installed, and its source code is available on the developer’s GitHub.
