* Have you ever misplaced the Siri remote for Apple TV? Even if you haven’t, it’s a great idea to have a backup remote and you don’t have to buy anything. You can set up your iPhone as a backup and it’s easy to do.
* The first thing you need to do is download an app from the App Store. Apple offers two different options that you can use and both are available for free.
* The Apple TV Remote app is specifically for the Apple TV and so easy to set up and use once you download it.
* Turn on your Apple TV and open the app. The app should automatically find your Apple TV. If not, make sure that your device is on the same Wi-Fi network as your Apple TV.
* To use the app, just glide your finger in the large open section at the top. To open an app, just tap.
* The app has a Menu button just like your Siri remote. You also have buttons to play and pause a show or music, go straight to the TV App on your Apple TV, or summon Siri.
