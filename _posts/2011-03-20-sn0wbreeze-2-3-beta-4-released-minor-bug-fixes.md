* iH8Sn0w has pushed another update to his Windows jailbreak tool for iOS 4.3. Sn0wBreeze 2.3b4 adds some bug fixes and more baseband compatibility.
* Sn0wBreeze 2.3 offers a tethered jailbreak solution for iOS 4.3, but the tool is still in beta. This means that stability is not guaranteed, and you should use it at your own risk…

* Sn0wBreeze 2.4b4 changelog:
* So, besides some added UltraSn0w support, there’s not anything too significant about this new beta version of Sn0wBreeze 2.3.
* We still recommend holding off on Sn0wBreeze 2.3 until an untethered solution is available. No one wants to have to re-jailbreak every time the iPhone reboots.
* If you’re still feeling adventurous, check out our tutorial on how to jailbreak with the Sn0wBreeze 2.3 beta. The latest and greatest version of Sn0wBreeze 2.3 can be downloaded here.
* Let us know if you experience any problems with Sn0wBreeze 2.3b4. Was the jailbreak successful for you?
