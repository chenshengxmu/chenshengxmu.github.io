* The native quick reply interface in iOS is useful because you can respond to several kinds of notifications from many different apps from almost anywhere in iOS. On the other hand, the Send button is in an awkward place, and that’s what a new free jailbreak tweak called Quick Send hopes to fix.
* So why is the Send button considered to be in a weird place in the stock quick reply interface?
* Well, your hands are already at the bottom of the screen to type on the keyboard when you’re composing a reply, so it seems to make more sense for the Send button to be located on the keyboard rather than all the way at the top of the screen.
* As a result, Quick Send makes things a little more convenient by putting the Send button right where it’s easier to reach, especially on bigger devices, like those with the 5.5-inch display. It takes the place of the “Return” key on the keyboard, and when you press it, your reply gets sent to the person as you’d expect it to.
* The tweak does eliminate the ability to put space in between individual paragraphs from the quick reply interface because it hides the Return key, but what you gain is a much more convenient way of sending messages with one hand through the quick reply system.
* It’s worth noting that Quick Send only works with third-party apps, like Facebook Messenger in our example.
* The developer has told us that it doesn’t work with the stock Messages app because it’s missing a necessary component for Quick Send to work with it. With that in mind, it’s unknown if there will ever be a workaround in a future version of this tweak.
* Without any options to configure, Quick Send is a really simple tweak that starts to change the function of your device immediately after installation.
* If you’re interested in giving it a try, you can download it on your jailbroken device for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository right now.
* What do you think about Quick Send? Do you wish it supported the Messages app too? Share your thoughts below.
