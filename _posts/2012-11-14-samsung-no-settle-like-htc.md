* Last week, Apple and HTC grabbed a number of headlines when they announced that they had reached a global settlement in patent litigation, effectively ending several ongoing lawsuits between the two companies.
* Unsurprisingly, the news has sparked some hope that the iPad-maker would reach a similar deal with its arch enemy, Samsung. But according to a new report, the South Korean company has no intentions to settle…
* 9to5Mac points to a report by Yonhap news, which cites comments from a Samsung executive:
* “It may be true that HTC may have agreed to pay 300 billion won (US$276 million) to Apple, but we don’t intend to (negotiate) at all,” Shin Jong-kyun, who heads the South Korean tech giant’s mobile and IT division, told reporters.”
* Samsung and Apple have been entangled in a world-wide patent war since early 2011. Recent happenings in the battle include a major $1 billion victory for Apple here in the US, and a significant win for Samsung in the UK.
* Few details have been revealed about the Apple-HTC settlement, but word is that HTC will pay Apple between $6 and $8 per handset sold, or $280 million a year. The two have also signed a 10-year cross-licensing patent deal.
* What’s your take on Shin Jong-kyun’s comments? Should Samsung settle with Apple?
