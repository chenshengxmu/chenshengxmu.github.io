* Apple on Monday announced News, a new app for iOS 9, during its WWDC keynote in San Francisco. The app is a direct challenge to Flipboard, in that it offers a curated selection of news and other content based on your interests, all wrapped in a beautiful package. 
* The app is impressive both in design and function. You pick a selection of publications and topics—News keeps track of more than a million topics, and gets smarter every time you read it. You can bookmark articles to read later, few photo galleries and much more.
* The articles can come from anywhere, but the best ones are built in News format. There are several launch parters including Conde Nast publications, ESPN, The New York Times and many others. Apple says “we think this offers the best mobile reading experience ever.”
* News will launch alongside iOS 9, first in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
