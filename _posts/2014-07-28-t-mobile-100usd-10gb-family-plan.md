* “Leaving my office last week, I pulled alongside a bus covered with yet another ad for AT&T’s ‘Best-Ever Pricing’ for families,” writes T-Mobile USA’s outspoken CEO John Legere in a blog post Monday.
* As is his wont, Legere couldn’t resist offering a scathing critique of AT&T’s family plan, calling it “funny” because “their deal is no deal at all” compared to the pricing of T-Mobile’s Simple Choice Family Plan.
* Regardless, Legere went on to announce a new competitive offering which will be launching later this month to give a family of four a total of ten gigabytes of high-speed LTE data (2.5GB each) in exchange for a cool hundred bucks per month. By comparison, AT&T’s “Best-Ever Pricing” offers four lines for $160…
* As a bonus, T-Mobile’s family plan comes with the usual Uncarrier perks such as unlimited talk, text, free international data and unlimited music streaming.
* The CEO lays out the math:
* AT&T’s “Best-Ever Pricing” four lines for $160 vs four lines for $100 with T-Mobile—with unlimited talk, text, and data plus up to 10 GB of LTE data on our data-strong network. Plus, their “Best-Ever” deal comes with a boatload of crap – domestic overages, international roaming fees, hidden device subsidy costs, and on and on.
* The $60 difference between AT&T’s and T-Mobile’s family plan translates into a $1,440 savings over the course of a two-year contract.
* They even put together a handy comparison chart, seen below.

* T-Mobile’s new family plan is set to launch on July 30, valid until 2016.
* According to 9to5Mac, Apple Stores right before the launch of the iPhone 6 this Fall will let customers purchase iPhones through major U.S. carriers’ early upgrade programs, including AT&T Next, Verizon Edge and T-Mobile Jump.
* Currently, customers who want to upgrade their phones more frequently by taking advantage of these early upgrade programs have to deal directly with their carrier.
* Apple’s brick-and-mortar and online stores in the United States offer customers the choice between purchasing the device with a new two-year contract at subsidized pricing, or buying an iPhone unlocked at full price.
* What do you think?
* Is T-Mobile’s $100 for 10GB of LTE data shared by four people a good deal?
