* If you’re like most jailbreakers, then you’re probably foaming at the mouth for something new to install on your device right now. While the iOS 10 jailbreak has been slow lately, we’ve seen some fairly impressive releases this week.
* In this roundup, we’ll show you all the jailbreak tweaks that launched in Cydia throughout the past work week. We’ll start with our favorites and move on to the rest of them afterward.

* Castro is a beautiful replacement for the stock volume HUD on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
* Although most tweaks relocate the volume HUD somewhere else to get it out of the way, Castro takes a different approach, remodeling the existing volume HUD where it has always been: in the center of the screen.
* The tweak is sensitive to Now Playing media, allowing it to display information about any playing media. Moreover, you can customize how it looks in a myriad of ways.
* To learn more about Castro and why it’s such a great release, read our full review.

* SSHIcon is a new free jailbreak tweak that I’m surprised has never existed until recently.
* This tweak puts an icon in your Status Bar whenever there’s an active SSH connection to your jailbroken iPhone or iPad.
* Because SSH is such a powerful tool that often yields root access to the SSHer, having this icon in the Status Bar is important so you can know if someone’s SSHing into your device in the background without your knowledge.
* The tweak is fully configurable so that you can change the frequency check and the look of the icon, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. You can also tap and hold on the icon to reveal information about current SSH connections.
* You can read our full review of SSHIcon to learn more about why it’s such an important release.
* Color Status Bar (System Wide): Lets you colorize your Status Bar with any color you want (free – review)
* F7K For Jodel: Adds features to the Jodel app (free)
* HideDeleteBox: Makes the app deletion button invisible (free – review)
* RedFailedMessages: Dyes messages that failed to send in the Messages app red (free – review)
* SmartLowPower: Lets you automate Low Power Mode in new ways to save power (free – review)
* SnapchatRecents: Makes it more easy to discern which of your incoming Snapchats are the most recent (free – review)
* Although that wraps things up for this week, more exciting releases are nearing completion and should find their way into Cydia soon. As always, you can stay tuned to iDB for all of the latest jailbreak news to stay on top of everything as it surfaces.
