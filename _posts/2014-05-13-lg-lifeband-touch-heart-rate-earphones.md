* This coming Sunday, May 18, LG will release a pair of new wearable products. Designed to work with iOS and Android, the Lifeband Touch Activity Tracker, as the name implies, is a wrist-worn fitness band which measures your physical activity performance – stuff like speed, steps taken, calories burned and covered.
* And LG’s new Heart Rate Earphones with built-in sensors will measure your heart rate as you listen to your music, make calls or just chill.
* Used together, these two products promise to help you reach and maintain your fitness goals while fusing advanced activity tracking, biometric data, Bluetooth app connectivity with easy access to your music and iOS device and what not. Both accessories can be pre-ordered now through Best Buy prior to launch…
* Featuring a 0.9-inch OLED screen to show real-time heart rate information, incoming text messes, phone calls with Caller ID, your music and more, the Lifeband Touch Activity Tracker also sports three built-in sensors: a three-axis accelerometer for acceleration information in all directions, altimeter for detailed ascent/decent data and GPS for location.

* Your real-time biometric information gets beamed via Bluetooth to LG’s free Fitness App running on iOS or Android. The mobile app interfaces with popular fitness software such as MyFitnessPal and RunKeeper, allowing you to share data.

* A built-in 90mAh battery is good for five days of use between charges. And if you’re using the new Heart Rate Earphones (outlined below), the fitness band will display your real-time heart rate readings on its OLED screen. The accessory retails for $150.
* Speaking of Heart Rate Headphones, these continuously monitor a range of data, including your metabolic rate and cardiovascular fitness (VO2 max, distance travelled and steps taken, calories burned, cadence and pace and more. A handy Voice Guide feature will update you on your heart rate and pace throughout the fitness program.

* How does this thing work then?
* LG’s Heart Rate Earphones are designed to provide accurate heart rate data by measuring blood flow signals in the ear via PerformTek sensor technology while also delivering excellent sound.
* The earphones are provided in two sizes and ship with three different earphone sizes with additional design elements to ensure a secure fit. The accessory connects to a wrist or arm-worn medallion device which actually takes care of sending data to a mobile device via Bluetooth.
* Note that the privilege of measuring your vital signs continuously, as you listen to your music, will set you back a cool $180.
* Both the Lifeband Touch Activity Tracker and Heart Rate Earphones are compatible with the iPhone and iPod touch devices running iOS 6 or later and will officially launch on May 18.
