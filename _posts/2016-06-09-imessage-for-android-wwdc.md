* Apple is planning to bring its encrypted messaging service iMessage to Android, reports MacDailyNews. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the site says that the company plans to announce the move at its WWDC keynote next week.
* If true—and that’s a big if—the move would push Apple further into the messaging space as it tries to grow its ‘Services’ category on the back of dwindling iPhone sales. Note that the Cupertino firm already offers Apple Music on Android.
* Apple will announce that iMessage encrypted text messaging is coming to Android users at WWDC next Monday at WWDC 2016, according to a source familiar with the company’s thinking.
* […] The source notes that plans are constantly in flux leading up to Apple keynotes and the timing of the announcement could change, but that the iMessage instant messenger service would “definitely” be coming to Android this year. As this is a single-sourced item, it’s been filed under “rumor.”
* Now, MacDailyNews doesn’t have much of a track record in reporting on Apple’s future plans, and we’ve seen zero corroborating reports thus far. So we’re taking this report with a large amount of skepticism, and advise you to do the same.
* Another issue we’re having here is coming up with good reasons for Apple to make such a move. Android has built-in messaging, and there are hundreds of third party options. Plus Apple doesn’t make money off the current iMessage model.
* Could Apple do this in hopes of wooing more Android users over to iPhone?
* What do you think?
