* Goat Simulator by Coffe Stain Studios is available at no charge as IGN’s new Free Game of the Month for August. Goat Simulator is a $5 download on the App Store so this is a nice treat on IGN’s part. In this game, you can be—you guessed right—a goat.
* It basically challenges you to cause as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. You can grab your free copy of the game through IGN’s webpage by following the instructions provided further below.
* Step 1: To grab your free download, first visit IGN’s promo page using Safari on your iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Mac.
* Step 2: Now hit the big red Get Free Game button just below the splash graphics.

* Step 3: Your promo code should appear on the screen.
* Clicking this code redeems your free copy of Goat Simulator.
* You can also manually copy and paste the code into the Redeem section of the App Store on the iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, or iTunes on Mac and Windows PCs.
* The promotion is available on a first-come, first-served basis to any gamer in the following countries: The United States, Algeria, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil Canada, Chad, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Vietnam.
* The offer is valid only on the US iTunes Store.
* Non-US readers may want to create themselves a US App Store account in order to game the system and take advantage of this freebie.
* If your country isn’t officially listed, try visiting the IGN webpage through an anonymous proxy web tool. I wholeheartedly recommend the free of charge SmartHide Online Anonymizer Simply choose the US Anonymizer option on the SmartHide webpage and paste the IGN promo URL into the text field.
* Now tap the Begin Browsing button and you’ll land on the IGN promo page. SmartHide should fool IGN into believing you were visiting their website from the United States so you should be able to claim your free download by following the steps outlined in the how-to section above.
* “Goat Simulator has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you’re a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff,” developers teased. “When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.”

* In Goat simulator, you get points for wrecking stuff.
* The game supports Game Center leaderboards and achievements. As developers themselves write in iTunes release notes, it’s “a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.”

* Interestingly, the game has a rating of four and a half stars in the App Store based on more than 21,000 ratings. Good thing IGN is providing Goat Simulator at no charge.
