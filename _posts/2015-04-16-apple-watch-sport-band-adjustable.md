* Following a recent TechCrunch report which claimed the Apple Watch Sport would ship with a three-piece band, the updated “What’s In The Box” section on the Online Apple Store has now confirmed that the fluoroelastomer band indeed includes three pieces to make either a Small/Medium (S/M) or Medium/Large (M/L) strap. The discovery was first made by MacRumors on Thursday.
* This is important to note given a flurry of unsubstantiated reports that have been flying around, claiming that the Apple Watch Sport would ship with two separate bands for sizing purposes.

* Based on the rumors alone, several third-party services, including BandSwapper, were hoping to market solutions that would permit customers to swap out their unused bands.
* But due to Apple’s now confirmed three-piece solution, Apple Watch Sport buyers may not need to swap out their unused band for a different size or color.
* Apple is currently selling the Watch exclusively online.
* Earlier this morning, an internal memo from Apple’s chief of retail and online stores has officially confirmed that the device is unlikely to be available for in-store purchases before June.
