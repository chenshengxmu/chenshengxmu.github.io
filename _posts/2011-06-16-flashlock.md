title: FlashLock Activates Your iPhone 4 Flash From the Lockscreen

* I know what you’re thinking: “we don’t need one more of these flashlight applications.” Even though Cydia and the App Store are flooded with Flashlight apps, I have a very special interest in FlashLock because it was my idea and I worked with developer Filippo Bigarella to bring it to life.
* Up until today, my flashlight app of choice was SpringFlash, but it never really did what I wanted. So, I asked one of my favorite tweak devs if he could make my dream flashlight app come true. And he did…
* To activate FlashLock, simply double tap the home button from your lockscreen and it will bring up the flashlight icon. Tap this icon and your iPhone 4 camera flash will light up until you tap the icon again. If you are familiar with iOS 5 and the way you can bring up the camera icon from the lockscreen, well, this is the same concept.
* I like this app because it’s simple and I find it much more practical than the SpringFlash toggle in SBSettings.
* You can get FlashLock for free from Filippo’s repo: http://filippobiga.me/repo. I believe it will also be available on one of the major repos soon.
* So, what do you think of FlashLock? What about the name of the app? I came up with it in about 10 seconds, and as you can tell, it’s not very original. But at least it is descriptive.
