* I think we all assumed that AT&T would support the iPhone’s Personal Hotspot feature that comes bundled with iOS 4.3, but its availability has been confirmed by an AT&T spokesperson.
* As we informed you yesterday, iOS 4.3 will makes its way to the public on the same day that the iPad 2 is released.
* AT&T spokesperson Seth Bloom has confirmed that the company’s Personal Hotspot support will go live once Apple makes iOS 4.3 available on March 11…
* Unfortunately, using the Personal Hotspot feature will come at a price, as Bloom confirmed that “…customers will need to subscribe to the DataPro 4GB/$45 tethering data plan.” That’s pretty comparable to what Verizon is charging to use the Hotspot feature.
* That’s means it’s a whole lot of coin to be able to tether your laptop to your iPhone. If you’re a jailbreaker, I definitely recommend checking out MyWi on demand; it’s a bit pricey up front, but it’s only a one-time fee.
* Will you be using the Personal Hotspot come March 11? Or will you be sticking with another solution?
