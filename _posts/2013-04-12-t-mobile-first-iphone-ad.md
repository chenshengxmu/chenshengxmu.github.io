* T-Mobile, the nation’s fourth-largest carrier, today finally gets to sell Apple’s iconic smartphone. We learned yesterday the Deutsche Telekom-owned telco has a massive ad blitz in the works to push the handset to the masses. And now, we just caught a glimpse of that campaign as T-Mobile starts airing its inaugural television commercial for the venerable iPhone…
* The voiceover proclaims:
* It’s the phone that’s revolutionizing phones. Make sure it’s running on a carrier that’s revolutionizing wireless.
* Introducing iPhone 5 on T-Mobile.
* With advanced nationwide 4G network and no more restrictive annual contracts required.
* Only T-Mobile lets your iPhone 5 be as great as an iPhone 5.
* Uncarrier, indeed.
* iPhone 5 is @tmobile Stores today. Are you on your way? t-mo.co/14VjKsL #SimpleChoice

* By the way, what’s up with that overly aggressive soundtrack?
* Update: as commenters pointed out, the choice of Hendrixs’ version of the national anthem is actually symbolic of the message T-Mobile is trying to get through. Accept my apologies, I’m based out in Europe.
* The iPhone 5 costs $99.99 down and $20 per month over the next 24 months. The 32GB/64GB versions are $199/$299 down. The iPhone 4S is $70 down plus $20 per month for 24 months and the iPhone 4 costs $15 down and $15 per month over the next 24 months.
