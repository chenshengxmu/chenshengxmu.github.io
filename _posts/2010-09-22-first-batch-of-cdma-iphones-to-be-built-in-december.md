* I just knew it. I knew it wouldn’t be long until the latest Verizon iPhone rumor hit the web waves and I’d be writing about it shortly thereafter. I did not think it would be as concrete as this appears to be.
* An analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group mentioned in a note to suppliers that Apple is preparing to build 3 million CDMA capable iPhones by December. This is to keep on track with an apparent early 2011 release. Are you getting a headache yet?
* Apple Insider has the full report that includes some predictions and speculations as far as sales are concerned. I don’t feel the need to share every sales prediction because to most people they are meaningless. That being said, I am surprised at the nonchalantness of the report. 3 million CDMA iPhones would certainly indicate a Verizon device.
* What do you think? What purpose would Apple have for making that many CDMA iPhones other than a Verizon release? Give us your stories in the comment box below.
