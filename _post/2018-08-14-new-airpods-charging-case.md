* Eleven months ago, Apple introduced an all-new inductive charging case for AirPods. That case, which is finally expected to be released in the coming weeks, is likely to work with any Qi-certified charging mat, according to the Chinese website, Chongdiantou. 
* The new AirPods charging case was first announced at last year’s iPhone X event on the Apple campus. It debuted alongside another long-delayed product, the AirPower charging dock. That accessory, probably priced at around $150, can charge various Apple products at the same time, including Apple Watch, iPhone, and yes, the all-new AirPods charging case.
* Like the other products, the AirPods charging case won’t work with the AirPower charging dock exclusively. Instead, it will support the Qi wireless charging protocol. This represents a change from the Apple Watch, which uses a modified version of the Qi standard that limits how it can be charged. Instead of standard Qi-certified charging mats, Apple’s wearable device requires the official charging cable and dock or MFi-certified third-party docks that ship with magnetic chargers.
* What’s still unclear is whether the new charging case will work with the first-generation AirPods or only the next generation model. This model, which was teased by Bloomberg in June, is likely to include a new chip and support for hands-free Siri activations. The current AirPods case uses a Lightning cable for charging.
* (Third-generation AirPods are expected to arrive sometime in 2019, according to Bloomberg in the same report. These premium earbuds could feature noise-cancellation and water resistance and have a more extended range.)
* Also in June, Bloomberg reported the AirPower charging mat would finally launch in September. Most likely, the new AirPods charging case will launch at the same time.
* We should know very soon. Apple’s almost certainly set to announce new iOS devices in the coming weeks, including three all-new iPhones and two next-generation iPad Pro models. A fourth-generation Apple Watch and updated Macs are also expected to make their debut as early as September.
