* Last week, 9to5Mac published what it claimed was the first official image of this year’s two upcoming OLED iPhones. At the time, the site said the long-rumored 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch models would be called iPhone Xs. Today, Sept. 5, 9to5Mac says the larger of these two models will likely be named the iPhone Xs Max. 
* Since the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus launched in 2014, Apple has used “Plus” in the name to describe its largest handset. However, this year, things might be different. 9to5Mac explains: “We’ve since learned that Apple will likely use “iPhone Xs Max” as the marketing name for the larger version of the new models.”
* Besides the two all-new OLED models, Apple’s also expected to reveal a new 6.1-inch LCD phone next week. All three models are likely to look similar to the iPhone X. However, the two OLED models are expected to ship with stainless steel on the sides. The less expensive LCD model could feature aluminum.
* Both the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max could be available in gold for the first time.
* Apple’s hardware-focused fall event is next Wednesday, Sept. 12, beginning at 10 a.m. PDT. Besides new iPhones, the company’s expected to announce two new iPad Pro tablets and the 2018 Apple Watch. The company will be streaming the event as it happens through the Apple website and on Apple TV.
* Do you like the iPhone Xs Max name or should Apple stick with Plus? Let us know below.
