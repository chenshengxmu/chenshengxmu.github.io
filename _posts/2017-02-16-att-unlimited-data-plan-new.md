* AT&T on Thursday announced that it is expanding its unlimited data plan offering to all customers. Starting tomorrow, all customers will be able to get unlimited talk, text and data on 4 lines for $180.
* The move follows a similar one by the carrier’s close competitor Verizon, who announced its own unlimited data plan earlier this week, and comes amidst strong pressure from both T-Mobile and Sprint.
* Of course, as with all promotions, there is some fine print here. AT&T says the $180 price tag comes after a $40 credit for the 4th smartphone line is applied, which takes 2 billing cycles. So you’ll actually have to pay $220 per month until the credit kicks in. Also, AT&T has the right to slow down your data speeds during “periods of network congestion” after you surpass 22GB.
* “We’re offering unlimited entertainment on the nation’s best data network where and when you want to enjoy more of what you love,” said David Christopher, AT&T’s CMO. The plan will be available to all post paid customers starting Friday.
