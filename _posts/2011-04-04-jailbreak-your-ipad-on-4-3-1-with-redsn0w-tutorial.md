* The long-awaited jailbreak for Apple’s iOS 4.3.1 is finally here. It is the first official jailbreak since Apple released iOS 4.3 almost a month ago. Those with iDevices wanting to take advantage of some of the new features in 4.3, haven’t been able to upgrade without losing their jailbreaks.
* That all changed in the wee hours of last night, when the Dev Team members finally released the anticipated software. The exploit is available in 2 different forms of software: PwnageTool, which is for Mac users only, and RedSn0w, which will work on either Windows or Mac.
* This step by step tutorial will show you how to jailbreak your iPad on iOS 4.3.1, using RedSn0w. If you are a Mac user and prefer to use Pwnage Tool, stay tuned. We will provide a tutorial for that software shortly. Either method is extremely easy, and will have your iPad jailbroken in no time.
* Important Note: Just remember this is not for the iPad 2, there is no jailbreak available for this device yet.
* Before we get started, you want to make sure your iPad is on iOS 4.3.1. Backing up your iPad to iTunes is also recommended, better safe than sorry.
* Step 1: For this tutorial, you’ll need RedSn0w which you can download here. Make sure you select version 0.9.6rc9, as it is the only one that will work. I always download my tools to my desktop so they’re easier to find.
* Step 2: For this method, you will need the actual 4.3.1 firmware file. If you don’t know where to find it on your hard drive, just download it to your desktop from here. Make sure you download the iPad file, 4.3.1.
* Step 3: Launch RedSn0w and click Browse. Find your 4.3.1 firmware from the previous step and select it.

* Step 4: The software will then give you a few options before continuing. For most of us, all we need is the Cydia icon. Make sure there is a checkmark by Install Cydia and click Next.

* Step 5: Plug in your device to your computer and turn it off. Now get ready to follow some onscreen instructions. RedSn0w will walk your through a few steps to put your iPad into DFU mode.
* Step 6: If you’re successful, RedSn0w will start its magic. Don’t worry if it doesn’t happen right away, just turn your iPad off, click back and try it again.
* Step 7: Once the software is done loading the exploit, your iPad will restarted, and your home screen should load up with the Cydia icon installed. Success!
* That is how you jailbreak your iPad on iOS 4.3.1 with RedSn0w. Any questions?
