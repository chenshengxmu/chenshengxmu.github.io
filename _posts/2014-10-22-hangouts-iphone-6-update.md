* Continuing its string of app updates adding native support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes, Google on Wednesday issued a small update to its Hangouts messaging software for the iPhone and iPad, which now looks as you’d expect on the 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6 screens.
* In addition to UI support for the new Apple smartphones, Hangouts 2.3 contains no other additions or improvements. The app is available free of charge in the App Store and requires iOS 6.0 or later.
* Google was fairly quick to update its most popular mobile apps with iPhone 6 support: Gmail, YouTube and Chrome now all look crisp on the new devices and take full advantage of the larger canvas.
* Thanks to a recent update, Hangouts now makes it easy to place phone calls within the app itself.
