* After launching a repair program two weeks ago for iPhone 6s devices experiencing unexpected shutdowns due to a faulty battery, Apple has now updated its support document with a web tool that lets you check if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a free battery, MacRumors reported Thursday. You only need to enter your device’s serial number to see if you’re eligible for a battery replacement service.
* Simply visit Apple’s web tool, type in your iPhone’s serial number in the text field and click Submit to instantly see if you’re eligible for a free battery from Apple, saving you a trip to an Apple Store or authorized service provider.
* You can find your device’s serial number on its back or in Settings → General → About.
* Alternatively, as 9to5Mac described, check for the following characters located in the fourth and fifth position of your iPhone’s serial number:
* “Apple store staff will be replacing batteries with spare parts where available, but otherwise will be sending out for battery replacement stock or in some cases replacing the entire device,” reads the article.
* Battery supplies may be constrained and some stores may have to wait until December 5 or later to receive stock for repairs, said the site.
* “One Apple store we spoke with had as many as 60 battery parts ordered for customers waiting for repairs, while other reports this week also indicated a supply shortage following the introduction of Apple’s new repair program,” according to 9to5Mac.
* At any rate, a faulty device should be taken to an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. The phone will be examined prior to the service to verify that it’s not damaged and the screen is not shattered.
* Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices that were manufactured between September and October 2015 may unexpectedly shut down.
* Wireless carrier partners are not participating in this worldwide program.
* Those who have already paid for a battery replacement service should check with Apple to see if they are eligible for a refund.
