* As I reported yesterday, Twitter has updated its Android app with the promised Instagram-competing photo filters, a first for the micro-blogging service seeking to supplant Instagram as your favorite photo sharing service. That, my friends, is a pretty tall order given Instagram’s popularity, the Facebook backing and a growing number of new features Instagram’s gaining. Be that as it may, Twitter has waited until this morning to roll out filters to its iOS client.
* You’re gonna love the ability to snap a scene, edit the photo with the filters supplied by Aviary and tweet out your work without jumping back and forth between Twitter and your go-to iPhoneography app. You can grab the free download right now from the App Store. More on other features right after the break…
* You’ve got these fine filters at your disposal: Vignette, Black & White, Warm, Cool, Vintage, Cinematic, Happy and Gritty.
* If you’re not sure which one to use, hit the auto-enhance button and let the app do the heavy lifting. Basic cropping controls and other photo editing tools are also available.
* Your release notes for Twitter version 5.2
* • create beautiful photos right within Twitter, with filters powered by Aviary • apply one of eight different filters to instantly add a new look and feel to your photos • choose a filter by comparing all your options in a convenient grid view or by swiping through each version • make your photos pop with balanced light and colors by tapping the auto-enhance wand • crop and scale to frame the action the way you want • we’ve also added many other improvements and fixes to this update
* Twitter even bothered creating this nice clip to explain filters.
* Twitter’s blog post offers more in way of detail, including seeing how each filter would affect your photo in a single grid view, or by swiping through previews to compare your options.
* If you’re on Android, grab the new Twitter app from your device from the Play Store.
* While Twitter’s photo filters do the job, I doubt the company will sway users to switch to sharing their photos on Twitter, not Instagram (and The Verge agrees).
* What do you think?
