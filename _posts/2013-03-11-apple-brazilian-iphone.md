* Apple may be able to use the iPhone trademark to sell its smartphone in Brazil. Lawyers have requested 30 days to reach an agreement outside of court, according to a weekend report. Brazil’s largest daily newspaper reported the two parties have dropped the lawsuit seeking ownership of the ‘iPhone’ trademark and plan a “pacific” agreement – likely to include a cash payment from the iPhone maker…
* Folha de São Paulo (via Fortune) reports that IGB Electronica, maker of Android-based devices carrying the IPHONE label, will settle with Apple.
* This follows a February ruling by Brazil’s Institute of Industry Property that a 2000 registration by IGB of the IPHONE name forbids Apple using the iPhone trademark in that country.
* Apple had appealed the ruling.
* However, this latest report, if proven correct, would follow previous branding disputes resolved after Apple wrote a check.
* In 2012, Apple payed China-based Proview $60 million to drop a challenge of the iPad trademark.
* When the iPhone launched in 2007, Cisco began a similar trademark challenge which was resolved a month later.
