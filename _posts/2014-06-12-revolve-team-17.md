* A British games development studio, Team17, has made a name for itself in the golden age of home computing back in the 1990s with its Worms series of amusing artillery strategy games.
* Today, they have released a brand new iOS game that I think deserves your attention. Called (R)evolve, it was prototyped in just 48 hours at 2014’s Great British Game Jam and came in first place.
* The free-to-play title challenges you to save cutesy alien creatures from meteor showers by spinning their planet. I know, it sounds simplistic, but aren’t all addictive games supposed to be simplified to the bone?
* Game mechanics couldn’t be more accessible: you just tap the left and right sides of the screen to rotate the planet.
* Doing so will save the planet’s charming inhabitants from a constant bombardment of meteorites from outer space.
* Do this well and your planet will be “teeming with green three eyed monsters,” explains Team17.
* Those meteorites travel fast, spin the planet around to avoid the danger and keep your alien population alive and growing.
* The crisp Retina graphics take full advantage of your device’s GPU power, have a look at the screenshots.

* It’s a really nicely done time-killer that I think will keep you occupied for some time. As (R)evolve is about boosting your score, it supports global leaderboards via Game Center.
* The more life you can evolve and the longer you can keep it alive, the higher your score will be – it’s as simple as that.
* Although (R)evolve has been released on a freemium basis, I’m glad that Team17 has done In-App Purchases the right way: there’s only a one-time 99-cent upgrade to remove in-game advertising.
* Download (R)evolve free in the App Store.
* You’ll need an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad capable of supporting iOS 6.0 or later.
