* LTE coverage is becoming an increasingly hot topic for Apple users here in the US. After waiting more than a year to utilize the high-speed 4G technology, Apple made its latest iPad LTE-capable. And it’s likely that its next handset will be as well.
* So which carrier has the best LTE coverage in the US? Verizon — by a long shot. And it’s not showing any signs of slowing down. PhoneArena is reporting that Verizon has just lit up LTE in several areas in California, and in Reno, Nevada…
* According to the site, Stockton, Fresno, Monterey, and the San Francisco Bay areas are now all set to receive Verizon’s incredibly fast 4G data speeds. And Reno, Nevada — which is often referred to as a miniature Las Vegas, is also now covered with LTE.
* Verizon’s LTE network now covers more than 200 million people, in well over 200 markets. Thanks to its one-year head start, it’s buildout is miles ahead of AT&T’s, which is currently only in about 30 markets. Yikes.
