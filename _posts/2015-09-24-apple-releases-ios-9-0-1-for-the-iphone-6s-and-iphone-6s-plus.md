* It’s not even officially out yet, but Apple has released the first firmware update for the iPhone 6s. iOS 9.0.1, an update that contains several bug fixes, was released yesterday for older devices, but Apple has gone ahead and released the 9.0.1 update just ahead of tomorrow’s iPhone 6s launch as well.
* Last night, I posted a video discussing the iOS 9.0.1 update. Again, this update brings no new features to the table, but it enhances stability for iOS 9, something that isn’t too uncommon for x.0 releases.
* Here is the full iOS 9.0.1 change log from Apple:
* When you receive your iPhone 6s tomorrow, it will come with iOS 9.0 pre-installed. Therefore, you’ll need to perform an OTA update via Settings → General → Software Update in order to grab the latest version of iOS. Users also have the option of connecting to iTunes and updating, but it’s much easier to perform an update on device instead.
* Only a few more hours left, folks.
