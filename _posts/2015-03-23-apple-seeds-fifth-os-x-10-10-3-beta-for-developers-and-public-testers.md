* Apple seeded the fifth beta of OS X 10.10.3 on Monday, available to download for registered developers and public AppleSeed beta testers. The beta, carrying build number 14D113c, is available to download via the Updates tab of the Mac App Store or from the Mac Developer Center.
* Apple also released a Yosemite Recovery update, bumping it to version 3.0.
* The release of the new OS X 10.10.3 comes close to a week after the fourth beta of the software. There’s no word on when Apple plans to release OS X 10.10.3 to the public.
* We’ve seen a number of new features thus far in the 10.10.3 betas, including support for Google 2-step verification when setting up accounts, Force Touch APIs for developers, various emoji improvements, and of course the all new Photos application.
* As always, if you find something new we haven’t mentioned, e-mail us at tips@idownloadblog.com.
