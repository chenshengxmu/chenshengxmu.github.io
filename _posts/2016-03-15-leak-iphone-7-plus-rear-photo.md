* Chinese website Bastille Post on Tuesday published a purported image of Apple’s forthcoming iPhone 7 Plus that it swears is the real deal.
* The photo, obtained from an unnamed source,  seems to corroborate prior rumors that the iPhone 7 Plus will come outfitted with a dual-lens camera system on the back.
* It also reveals a curious hardware addition that the rumor-mill has not predicted thus far: a Smart Connector. If true, the Smart Connector may be coming to all iOS devices. As you know, Apple first unveiled the Smart Connector on the iPad Pro last fall. 
* MacRumors think that the three dots towards the bottom of the device appear to be for a Smart Connector. The Smart Connector interface is also set to debut on an upcoming, smaller iPad Pro model.
* As you can see for yourself, the claimed photo of the iPhone 7 Plus appears to show a slightly protruding, pill-shaped dual-lens camera on the back. Prior rumors have called for a nearly flush dual-lens camera as an iPhone 7 Plus exclusive feature.
* Aside from the dual-lens camera, the photo appears to show a microphone and an LED flash, as seen on previous iPhones. Most notably, the antenna seams along the top and bottom edges on the back are nowhere to be seen.
* Apple is holding a media event on March 21 and the press is expecting to see a brand new four-inch iPhone SE model, a smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro, new Apple Watch bands and possibly other product updates and announcements.
