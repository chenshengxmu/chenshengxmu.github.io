* As most of you know, Apple released an update to iOS last week, bringing the firmware to 5.1.1. The new software doesn’t contain much more than bug fixes, but if you updated to it, you’ll want to save your SHSH blobs.
* Luckily you can do that with the latest version of TinyUmbrella. NotCom has just released TU 5.11.00 with support for the latest version of iOS. And if you haven’t been saving your SHSH blobs, you might want to start…
* With the recent RedSn0w release, the ability to downgrade your device’s firmware has been fully restored for A5 users. But to utilize the new feature, you need to have the SHSH blobs from an earlier version of iOS.
* So yeah, to say that saving your blobs is important is an understatement. It could sometimes be the difference between having a jailbroken device and not.
* You can download the latest version of TinyUmbrella from our Downloads page.
