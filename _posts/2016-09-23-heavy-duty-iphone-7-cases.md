* Although Apple has taken some major steps this year to make the iPhone more durable, the device is still very susceptible to bumps and scratches. This is why we recommend putting a case on your smartphone if you want it to stay in like-new condition.
* We’ve already recommended a number of different cases, but for those who work and use their phones in more harsh environments, a heavy-duty case is the only way to go. Here are a few we like so far that are available for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus right now.

* The OtterBox brand is synonymous with heavy duty/rugged smartphone cases, and the Defender is one of its most popular lines. It features a robust, 3-layer design with built-in screen protector that helps your iPhone withstand scratches, drops and bumps. It also has a belt-clip holster, that doubles as a kickstands, and port covers to keep out dust and debris. Comes with a 1-year warranty.
* You can buy the OtterBox Defender case for iPhone 7 for $50 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $60.

* The ArmorBox case from i-Blason features a dual-layer design with a polycarbonate hard shell exterior and flexible TPU inner core. Like the Defender it too has a built-in bubble free screen protector and a built-in belt clip holster. Button covers and port plugs keep your handset free from dust and debris.
* You can buy the i-Blason ArmorBox for iPhone 7 for $18 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $19.

* The Rugged Armor case from Spigen isn’t nearly as heavy-duty as some of the other cases, but it’s a nice blend of portability and protection. It features a dual-layer design with a flexible tpu interior and then a tough polycarbonate exterior. Spigen says it offers military-grade protection and of course it looks sharp.
* You can buy the Spigen Rugged Armor case for the iPhone 7 for $11 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $12.

* Supcase has a fairly solid record on Amazon for creating well-made inexpensive cases, and it looks like the Rugged Holster case is no different. Early reviews are good for this dual layer case, which features a built-in screen protector and belt clip holster. This case comes in multiple colors and is available for both iPhone 7 models.
* You can buy the Supcase Rugged Holster for the iPhone 7 for $20 and for the iPhone 7 Plus for $21.50.
