* Hot off the heels of the new iOS 4.3.1 untethered jailbreak, there seems to be word going around that the jailbreak causes WiFi issues.
* @i0n1c, the hacker who found the untethered kernel exploit for iOS 4.3.1 which the Dev Team intergrated into the RedSn0w jailbreak utility, clears up some confusion regarding the WiFi issues…
* i0n1c mentioned via Twitter that the one of the reasons the RedSn0w/PwnageTool utility had been delayed was the mysterious WiFi issues. Later on they found out it wasn’t the jailbreak that was causing the issues, but rather the new iOS 4.3.1.
* BTW: One of the reasons why the PwnageTool + RedSn0w tool was delayed was do to the mysterious WiFi issues. Turns out the issues also occur without a jailbreak.
* According to i0n1c, the issues can be resolved for some iPhone owners by simply rebooting the router.
