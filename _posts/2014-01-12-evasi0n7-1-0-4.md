* Hot on the heels of yesterday’s release of evasi0n7 1.0.3, evad3rs today pushed another update to the iOS 7 jailbreak tool. evasi0n7 1.0.4 provides important untether security updates as well as a fix for the iPad mini with Retina display issues.
* This is the second evasi0n7 update in two days. Yesterday’s release was also supposed to provide a fix for the boot loop issue that some Retina iPad mini users were affected by, yet many still encountered the problem. As the evad3rs note, evasi0n7 1.0.4 will hopefully fix this problem once and for all…
* Current users already using a jailbroken device will receive this important security update via Cydia. The update is currently available and should show up under “evasi0n7 7.x Untether” when you refresh Cydia.
* As always, you can download evasi0n7 1.0.4 from our Downloads page. Newcomers to the jailbreak scene may also want to refer to our evasi0n7 tutorial for Mac and its Windows version.
* If you were having the reboot issue on your iPad mini, please make sure to let us know if this update finally fixed the problem for you.
