* Aside from releasing a sixth developer beta of iOS 10.3.3 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, Apple today seeded a sixth beta of the forthcoming macOS Sierra 10.12.6 software update.
* macOS Sierra 10.12.6 beta 6 has a build number 16G24b.
* It can be downloaded and installed on a compatible Mac using the Software Update mechanism through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab. Only Apple’s registered developers and members of the paid Apple Developer Program are allowed to beta-test macOS Sierra 10.12.6.
* The new beta arrived nearly ten days following macOS Sierra 10.12.6 beta 5.
* Like with iOS 10.3.3, users won’t see any important outward-facing changes in macOS Sierra 10.12.6 when it releases for public consumption. This is a point release that will fix bugs and improve the security and performance of your Mac.
* Apple is currently testing macOS High Sierra with its developers ahead of its release in the fall.
