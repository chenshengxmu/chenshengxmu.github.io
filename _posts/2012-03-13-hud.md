* Want a quick and easy way to visualize when the music you’re listening to skips to the next track? If so, then Hud may be up to the task.
* Unlike a tweak such as MusicBanners, Hud places the album art and track name smack square in the middle of your iPhone’s screen.
* Check out our video demonstration of Hud inside…
* Hud plays nice with music apps such as Spotify, and it will showcase the head up display everywhere except the Lock screen. Interestingly enough, the description of the tweak says it doesn’t work with the iPod app, which I found a bit peculiar. I tested it out, and sure enough it worked fine with the iPod/Music app.
* Hud can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s ModMyi repo. Let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
