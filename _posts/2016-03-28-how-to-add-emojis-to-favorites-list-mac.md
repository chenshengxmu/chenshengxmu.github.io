* Not too long ago, we showed you a keyboard shortcut you could use to bring up the Emoji picker from almost anywhere a text field could be accessed in the macOS operating system.
* Being familiar with how to access your Emojis is one thing, but it’s also possible to add Emojis to a dedicated favorites list in the Emoji picker. This makes it easier for you to access your favorite Emojis at a later date without having to search too hard for them.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how you can add Emojis to your favorites list in the Emoji picker on your Mac.
* Although your Mac automatically keeps track of the Emojis that you use the most frequently, any time your Emoji habits change, this list will change along with it. The favorites list is one that remains static over time, so no matter how much your Emoji habits change, you’ll be able to access your favorite Emojis from the Favorites list at any time.
* Because of this, we recommend you add the Emojis you like the most to it. This will save you the trouble of having to search through all of the categories when an Emoji you want to use is suddenly no longer available under the frequently used section on your Mac.
* To add Emojis to your Favorites List, open an app on your Mac that is capable of handling Emojis, such as the Messages app. We’ll be using the Messages app for this tutorial, so it’s best if you follow along with the same app.
* 1) With an Emoji-supportive app open on your Mac, use the keyboard shortcut Control + Command ⌘ + Space to bring up the Emoji picker.
* 2) From the Emoji picker, click on the small button at the top right of the interface.

* 3) A new window opens; select an Emoji from the window that you’d like in your favorites list and click on the Add to Favorites button on the right side of the window.

* 4) Once you’ve added a few favorites, click on the Favorites option in the window’s sidebar to confirm the Emojis were added.

* Congratulations; you’ve just added Emojis to your favorites list on your Mac!
* Now when you use the keyboard shortcut or Emoji button via the text field in the Messages app, or any other Emoji-supported Mac app, you’ll see a section labeled Favorites in the Emoji picker:

* The contents of the favorites list in your Emoji picker will never change unless you manually delete existing Emojis or you add new ones to the list. The frequently used Emojis section will continue to update in real time depending on your Emoji-using habits.
* If you ever end up changing your mind on what Emojis are your favorites, or you add one by mistake, removing them from the favorites list is also simple. Just follow steps 1 and 2 again from the list of steps above, and then follow step 4.
* Once you have the interface open that shows your list of favorite Emojis, select the one you want to remove from the list and click on the Remove from Favorites button.

* Piece of cake!
* When you have a set amount of Emojis that you like to use often, adding them to your favorites list from your Mac’s Emoji picker can help you get to them a lot faster. After all, it’s no fun having to dig through a myriad of different faces and symbols all the time just to find the one good one you want to use for a specific conversation.
* And of course, if you should ever want to go back and modify your favorites list, now you know how to do that too!
