* I hate carrying a bunch of stuff around with me wherever I go. I try to pair down to the minimum, which means a couple of cards, some cash, my iPhone, and maybe some Chapstick (oh, and candy… always gotta have candy). To me, a wallet is a bulky, unnecessary addition that I don’t want to deal with.
* CM4’s Q Card Case for iPhone 6s is perfect for holding your cards and cash so you don’t need a wallet. It’s ultra thin (as wallet cases go), so you’re still ahead when it comes to stuffing your pockets. Now you can have more room for candy.
* The case features a durable hard shell that snaps securely onto the iPhone 6s. It is coated in soft rubber for better gripping. The wallet pouch, which easily holds three cards plus cash, is made from faux leather material with an executive stitch for a classic look.
* There is a small hole at the bottom of the wallet pouch so you can easily push out your cards or cash, even if they fit tightly into the slot.
* The case features protective button covers that are specially designed with a familiar tactile click response and all ports are exposed for easy access.
* The cutout for the back-facing camera is extra large to combat issues with flash interruptions. The front lip extends past the iPhone 6s screen just enough to give you protection from scratches when laying on flat surfaces.
* CM4’s Q Card Case for iPhone 6s comes in black onyx, brown leather, champagne gold, gunmetal gray, pacific green, and red rouge. It is available on Amazon for between $40 and $60, depending on your color choice. There is a version for the iPhone 6s Plus with the same color options at the same price.
