* Twitter has now banned Alex Jones and Infowars for its service. The decision comes one month after other companies prohibited the conspiracy theorist from their outlets, including Apple, Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube. The decision came after Twitter determined Jones was in violation of its “abusive behavior” rules, according to Twitter, via the Associated Press.
* The permanent banning came after Jones posted a video on Wednesday that showed him shouting at and berating CNN journalist Oliver Darcy for about 10 minutes during congressional hearings about social media in Washington, D.C. With the ban, Jones will not be allowed to create new accounts on Twitter or take over any existing ones.
* In announcing the ban, Twitter explains:
* Today, we permanently suspended @realalexjones and @infowars from Twitter and Periscope. We took this action based on new reports of Tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behavior policy, in addition to the accounts’ past violations. https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior
* Before the accounts were removed, Jones had 900,000 Twitter followers, while Infowars had about 430,000. Earlier, Twitter had banned Jones for a week.
* In August, companies like Apple and Facebook pulled content from Jones. At the time, Twitter was the only major social network that kept him and his material online.
