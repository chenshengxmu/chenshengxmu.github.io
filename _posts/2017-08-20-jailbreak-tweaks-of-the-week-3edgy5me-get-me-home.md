* 3Edgy5Me is a fun and quirky jailbreak tweak that brings Galaxy S8-style notification animations to the iPhone. These animations appear whenever you have missed notifications, and they can be customized.
* You can not only change the animation style, but you can also change the color of the lines; the default is blue.
* It seems like a great way to spice up what’s otherwise a boring notification experience on your iPhone or iPad, so if you’re interested in learning more about how 3Edgy5Me works, you can read our full review.
* Get Me Home – $1.00

* Uber or Lyft users might want to take advantage of Get Me Home, which is a useful new tweak that lets you summon an Uber or a Lyft more quickly by typing a special phrase into Spotlight.
* You can set the coordinates for your desired location inside the tweak’s preferences pane, which makes it that much easier to get to your desired location when your ride arrives.
