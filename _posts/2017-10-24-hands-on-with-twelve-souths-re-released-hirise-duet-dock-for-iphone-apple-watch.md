* Last year, we took a look at the Duet HiRise charging dock from Twelve South.
* This tightly integrated dock had a built in Lightning cable as well as a magnetic Apple Watch puck. Unfortunately, it was temporarily discontinued soon after launch. After a long wait, the HiRise Duet is now once again available for purchase.
* As a refresher, here is our review from last December.

* The Duet is quiet a handy dock for your iPhone and watch.
* Not only does it have everything integrated into its design, but also has superior power output.
* Between the two components, it has fifteen watts of available power, which is quite a bit faster than the 5W adapter that Apple includes with every iPhone.
* Twelve South says the dock charges your iPhone approximately forty percent faster than your standard in-box charger or wireless charging. Unfortunately, it still isn’t quite as fast as using that Lightning to USB-C cable on the latest iPhones.
* The accessory’s integrated charging disc lets you position your Apple wearable in nightstand mode, making this the perfect bedside table accessory.
* The space saving is also great.

* Even the other fantastic dual-charging devices, like the Valet from Belkin, make up a much larger footprint than the Duet. When space is a premium, smaller is better. The tactic of stacking both chargers is a unique take that really pays off.
* Twelve South says they struggled with supply of the Apple Watch charging pucks, but lately we’ve seen a windfall for Apple Watch accessories. It appears the supply chain is much better suited to supply manufacturers with the parts they need to keep their products on the shelves.
* The Duet is on the more expensive end of docks, but that price can be offset by two things: the space you save with an all-in-one solution, as well as the costs of each of the components.
* If you bought an Apple Watch cord, iPhone cord, two wall adapters and a dock, it would cost more than the Duet. The rub is that most people have these accessories and don’t necessarily need to purchase them again.
* If you’d like to pick up Twelve South’s HiRise Duet, you can find it for $119 on their website.
* Let us know what you think of the Duet below.
* How does it align as a multi purpose dock? Do you have another favorite instead?
