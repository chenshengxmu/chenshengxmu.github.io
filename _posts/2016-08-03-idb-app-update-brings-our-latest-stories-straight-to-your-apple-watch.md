* If you’ve been staring at your wrist for the last four months hoping to one day be able to read iDB stories straight for your Apple Watch, then I have some good news for you.
* The good news is of course that we have added support for Apple Watch, letting you browse our latest articles without even having to unlock your iPhone. Welcome to the 21st century!
* This release is a typical case of “we did it because we can.” Yes, we realize reading articles on a tiny screen in a very awkward wrist twist is not comfortable and somewhat impractical. But heck, if several lines of code can allow us to do that, why wouldn’t we?
* When launching the Watch app, you will be presented with a feed of the latest stories on iDB, each of which showing an image and a headline. If you want to read more about a story, simply tap on it and it will display the intro paragraph, which should be enough to give you the meat of the story.

* If you want to do more reading about an article, you can easily add it to your bookmarks and pick it up now or later directly from your iPhone.
* Besides this feature, the app also comes with a few bug fixes that you likely never experienced in the first place.
* Of course, subscribers enjoy all the same features as before, specifically the removal of ads, unlimited bookmarks, and offline reading for bookmarked articles. If you want to support iDB, buying a one-month $0.99 or a one-year $2.99 in-app purchase is the best way to do so.
* As always, we want to thank you for your support and we hope to be able additional features in the months to come.
* If you haven’t yet, you can download the iDB app for free in the App Store.
