* As promised, Tuesday morning Apple released the free iOS 8.4 software update which introduces an all-new Music app with Apple Music and Beats 1 built-in. The over-the-air update is now available for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices. As these things take some time to propagate, the software update may not show up in your region yet.
* “This update introduces Apple Music—a revolutionary music service, 24/7 global radio, and a way for fans to connect with their favorite artists—all included in the redesigned Music app,” release notes accompanying the update explain. “iOS 8.4 also includes improvements for iBooks and bug fixes,” Apple states.
* To apply the update over-the-air, open the Settings app on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad and choose Software Update in the General section. Alternatively, connect your device via USB cable to a Mac or Windows PC running the latest version of iTunes and an update prompt should pop up automatically.
* If you enjoy jailbreaking as much as we do, you’re wholeheartedly advised to read this first in order to prepare for iOS 8.4 properly.
* iOS 8.4 includes several new features mostly revolving around Apple Music, Beats 1 and iTunes Radio along with several enhancements and refinements of existing features.
* The redesigned Music app now includes the new Apple Music service with Beats 1 radio station, a mini-player that can be pulled down or brought up from any screen, the ability to add your own thumbnail and description to any playlist and much more.
* The new Music experience includes a more streamlined iTunes Radio experience, a new Global Search option, Up Next queuing and other improvements.
* Next, iOS 8.4 allows digital publications created with Apple’s free iBooks Author app to be viewed on your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus complete with videos, Study Cards, the glossary, highlights and linked online content.

* Before today, only digital textbooks were supported on iPhones.
* On a similar note, Audiobooks—a feature that was previously part of the stock Music app—has been relocated to the iBooks app. A new Audiobooks for CarPlay is available with iOS 8.4 as well, giving drivers a dedicated app for hands-free listening of their audiobooks.
