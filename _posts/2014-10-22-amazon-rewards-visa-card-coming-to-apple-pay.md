* The online retail giant Amazon confirmed to GeekWire that it is in fact working to enable the Amazon.com Rewards Visa Card offered by Chase for use on Apple Pay, as MacRumors first noted on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Seattle, Washington headquartered company did not specify when it would be available. This is a major development as Amazon is among the companies not supporting Apple Pay initially.
* Although Chase-issued Amazon.com Rewards Visa Card is not currently accepted in Apple Pay, other co-branded Chase cards are.
* As Apple specified yesterday in a support document, corporate plastic is not not currently accepted in Apple Pay, as are not certain prepaid cards and loyalty and gift cards issued by some banks.

* Furthermore, Apple Pay is currently limited to eight cards at any one time.
* In addition, some users have reported minor issues with transactions not registering or being charged twice as Apple and its partners continue to perfect the service. International Apple Pay launch is likely in the cards as the service has been found to already work internationally, but only with U.S.-issued credit cards.
* Apple Pay launched Monday at more than 200,000 retail locations in the United States. The service requires iOS 8.1 and currently supports the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. However, Apple Pay will be coming to the iPhone 5, 5c and 5s when Apple Watch, which includes NFC, launches in early-2015.

* Despite the aforementioned limitations, Apple is said to be adding a loyalty program to Apple Pay in time for the busy holiday shopping season. Because retailers’ proprietary credit cards are not supported in Apple Pay, some customers might miss out on discounts tied to their store cards.
