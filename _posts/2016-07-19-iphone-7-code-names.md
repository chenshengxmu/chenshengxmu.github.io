* The rumor-mill briefly toyed with the idea of so-called ‘Pro’ model being added to this year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus lineup. We even saw claimed iPhone 7 Pro dummy case and an alleged detailed iPhone 7 Pro design schematics. On the other hand, lack of leaked iPhone 7 Pro parts casts doubt on that theory.
* According to prolific leakster Evan Brass of @EVLeaks, who this morning tweeted purported iPhone 7 code-names, the iPhone 7 Pro may not be in the cards for 2016 iPhone lineup after all.
* According to Brass, the upcoming 2016 iPhones are code-named Sonora and Dos Palos after small towns in California.
* The 2 (two!) 2016 iPhone models are codenamed Sonora and Dos Palos.

* By the way, Dos Palos means “two sticks.”
* Go figure!
