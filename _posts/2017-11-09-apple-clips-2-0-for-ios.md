* Aside from today’s release of iOS 11.1.1 that fixed an issue where “Hey Siri” stopped working and squashed the embarrassing “A [?]” autocorrect bug, Apple also announced a major update to its Clips social video app for iPhone and iPad.
* With Clips, you can easily create personalized, expressive videos on your iOS device.
* Clips 2.0 comes with a thoroughly revamped user interface, 360-degree selfie scenes on iPhone X, iCloud support, a bunch of new movie posters, effects, filters and Star Wars-themed stickers, as well as a bevy of additional features, such as a new Effects browser, 3D Touch support, 21 new royalty-free soundtracks and more.
* Apple explains how the TrueDepth camera on iPhone X removes the background and places you into animated, 360-degree Selfie Scenes that surround you on all sides as you move your phone complete with environmental sound effects:
* Selfie Scenes is an exciting new feature that places users into animated, 360-degree scenes when recording selfies. Using the sophisticated TrueDepth camera system on iPhone X, Selfie Scenes transports users into bustling cities, serene landscapes, abstract paintings and even the Millennium Falcon and Mega-Destroyer from “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”
* The new artistic-style transfer effects use machine learning to turn any photo or video into a moody oil painting, vibrant watercolor or elegant pencil sketch—in real time while recording.

* You get more branded content from Disney, like fullscreen posters featuring Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, as well as 16 new Apple-designed stickers and 21 new royalty-free soundtracks from indie artists. Like before, these new tracks automatically adjust to match the length of videos.
* And with iCloud support, you can now start a video on iPhone and finish it later on iPad, or vice versa, via iCloud. It’s especially nice that the media in your iCloud Photo Library are referenced by Clips rather than copied in order to make efficient use of iCloud storage.
* Here’s everything new in Clips 2.0:
* Keep in mind that iPhone 7 or later or 2017 iPad Pro is required for some filters.
* Clips is available at no charge from App Store.
