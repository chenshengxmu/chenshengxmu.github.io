* There’s something delightful about an iOS game that get’s it right. Angry Birds did it, and countless other games have risen above the noise in the App Store to become staple games for the iPhone.
* Tiny Wings, by Andreas Illiger, is a wonderful little game that features simple gameplay and subtle charm. As the perfect impulse buy that will keep you coming back for more, Tiny Wings is one of the best games to hit the App Store since Angry Birds.
* The Tiny Wings official description,
* “You have always dreamed of flying – but your wings are tiny. Luckily the world is full of beatiful hills. Use the hills as jumps – slide down, flap your wings and fly! At least for a moment – until this annoying gravity brings you back down to earth. But the next hill is waiting for you already. Watch out for the night and fly as fast as you can. Otherwise flying will only be a dream once again.”

* As you can tell, the premise behind Tiny Wings is very simple. You are a cute little bird with aerial navigation issues. You are trying to escape the darkness of night, but the hills in your way hinder your speed.
* Gameplay requires only one finger, and (just like Angry Birds) the real beauty of Tiny Wings lies in the physics engine. The true skill of the game rests in timing. As you figure out how to time the launch of the bird’s flight attempts, you will get better and better at gameplay.

* The colors and music in the game are splendid. Tiny Wings is one of those games that you won’t be able to put down. It’s easy to get lost in the design and kinetic motion of the game, and soon you’ll find that you’ve wasted 15 minutes trying to beat your last high score.
* The game is easy to start playing for the first time, but also hard to master. Those two things equal quite the addictive game.
* Tiny Wings is the perfect impulse buy. It’s available for $0.99 in the App Store.
* What do you think of Tiny Wings?
