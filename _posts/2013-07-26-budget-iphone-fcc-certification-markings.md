* Here’s a nice little nugget naysayers should chew on. A photograph that surfaced on a Chinese website earlier today appears to seemingly depict a plastic chassis, presumably belonging to Apple’s rumored less-pricey iPhone model.
* Now, we’ve seen these things previously shown off extensively in a high-resolution video, hires close ups and a bunch of  previously published photographs. What distinguishes this particular “leak” from others are the certification markings on the back – and that’s an unexpected treat in my book…
* As first noted by iPhone5Skopen.com, the photo emerged in a post over at Weibo, China’s popular micro-blogging service.
* As you can see for yourself top of post, the plastic backplate shows the iPhone logo as well as notices and markings from the FCC and other certification authorities.
* The previous leaks only had the iPhone logo imprinted on the back, have a look below.

* Here’s another one.

* You’re advised to take this with a grain of salt.
* For starters, the iPhone typeface on back (the shot top of post) looks a little bit thicker compared to the previous leaks, though it’s difficult to tell for sure due to the sharp angle of the shot.
* For all we know, this could be a 3D-printed practical joke of someone with too much time on their hands. Also worth mentioning: the markings suggest certification bodies such as FCC had already approved the device.
* We’re expecting both the iPhone 5S and the rumored budget iPhone (sporting a tweaked CPU with 1GB RAM) around the September-October timeframe. Now, some watchers speculate Apple might drop the iPhone 5 after the new models arrive so the simplified lineup should include only the ‘iPhone 5S’ and the ‘iPhone lite’, each apparently available in several different colors.
* This makes a lot of sense to me.
* The ‘iPhone lite’ (or budget iPhone) is thought to be a mid-tier device rather than a a bargain basement cheap iPhone. As such, it should effectively replace Apple’s older devices – the $450 iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S – to become the new entry-level choice tailored to budget-minded consumers.
