* Instagram’s iPhone app for high quality Time-lapse video capture, Hyperlapse, debuted a month ago.
* On Thursday, the software received its first update as developers released version 1.1 which has added native display support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones.
* In addition, there’s a new ‘selfielapse’ mode which uses the front-facing FaceTime camera to create cool Time-lapses.
* This edition of Hyperlapse includes bug fixes and reliability improvements as well. The app is available free of charge in the App Store.
* So there you have it, now you can goof with your friends in front of your iPhone to record a Time-lapse of your selfies — how cool is that?
* If you haven’t checked Hyperlapse out yet, you’re missing out on some rather unbelievable cinema stabilization which will make your shaky clips look like you’ve used a steady cam.
* The 9.7-megabyte app is universal and runs natively on any iPhone, iPod touch or iPad model supported by iOS 7.0 or later.
* Hyperlapse 1.1 changelog:
* As you know, iOS 8’s Camera app has introduced the brand new Time-lapse video capture mode. Although it has no controls whatsoever, it’s nonetheless plenty smart.
* According to Dan Provost of Studio Neat, Camera in iOS 8 doubles the speed of the Time-lapse and takes half as many pictures per second as the recording duration doubles. This ensures that your Time-lapses are always between 20 and 40 seconds long, an ideal shareable length.
