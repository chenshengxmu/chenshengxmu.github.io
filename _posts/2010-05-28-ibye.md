* Recently released by a developer named EvilPenguin under the ModMyI repo is a pretty cool and useful app called iBye.

* iBye can replace iTunes as far as backing your data. If you’re on the road and don’t have iTunes nearby or if you’re one of many anti-iTunes individuals out there, then iBye is perfect for you. iBye will backup your data and store that data on a FTP server of your choice . iBye will restore this data from the backup on that FTP server as well.
* In order to do this, you just need to get yourself an FTP server if you don’t already have one. Windows users can get one here. Mac users here.
* If you do not want to use a FTP server, then iBye will do a local backup and local restore on the iDevice itself.
* iBye supports your basic applications such as Mail, Notes, Safari, Calendar, Photos and Contacts along with your system log.
* It’s a great application to backup your important information on the fly (ie. your contacts).
* iBye also gives you the option to remove your data from the application of your choice if that’s what you want to do. This is helpful if you want to clear your calendar but don’t feel like going through each and every entry.
* For a little bit under what you usually pay for a gallon of gas in California, you can get iBye $2.99.
