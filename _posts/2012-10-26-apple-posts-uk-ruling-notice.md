* A week ago, Apple tried appealing a recent ruling by the High Court in London that Samsung’s Galaxy Tab didn’t infringe on its design patents. As you may recall, this is the same case where the presiding Judge ordered Apple to run advertisements stating that Samsung didn’t copy the iPad.
* Well, Apple lost that appeal. And this morning, it made good on its orders by posting a notice on the ruling to its UK website…
* From the posting:
* “On 9th July 2012 the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that Samsung Electronic (UK) Limited’s Galaxy Tablet Computer, namely the Galaxy Tab 10.1, Tab 8.9 and Tab 7.7 do not infringe Apple’s registered design No. 0000181607-0001.”
* Then, Apple gets a little cheeky, quoting the Judge on how consumers can’t confuse the Galaxy Tab with the iPad because “they’re not as cool.”
* “The informed user’s overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy Tablets is the following. From the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. They are not as cool.”
* Apple also points out some of its recent victories where Samsung was found to be guilty of patent infringement, including the recent US trial in which it was awarded $1B in damages.
* There’s a hyperlink to this posting located at the bottom of Apple’s UK home page, and it must remain there for one month. Apple also has to run the notice in British publications.
* Thoughts?
