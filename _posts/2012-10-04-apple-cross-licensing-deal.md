title: Apple offered Samsung a cross-licensing deal prior to trial

* As the wave of injunction motions and appeals requests continue in the aftermath of this summer’s high-profile Apple vs. Samsung trial, another interesting tidbit has been brought to light.
* According to recently-filed court documents, it looks like Apple tried to offer Samsung a cross-licensing deal involving 3G/UMTS patents back in April, hoping to avoid at least some litigation…
* AppleInsider reports:
* “A recently unredacted letter from Apple’s property licensing director Boris Teksler to his counterpart at Samsung, Seongwoo Kim, described a reciprocal deal in which each company would pay royalty rates for the other’s 3G/UMTS wireless patents under the same FRAND principles. The letter, which was included in a flurry of post-trial filings, was dated April 30, 2012, just three months before the Apple v. Samsung jury trial began.”
* For those unfamiliar with FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) terms, it’s a set of licensing obligations that are enforced by standard-setting organizations. These rules say that if you own patents that cover industry-essential inventions, you must license them out at a fair price.
* The site has the entire letter from Teksler, but here is one of the more interesting excerpts:
* “Apple is willing to license its declared-essential UMTS patents to Samsung on license terms that rely on the price of baseband chips as the FRAND royalty base, and a rate that reflects Apple’s share of the total declared UMTS-essential patents (and all patents required for standards for which UMTS is backward-compatible, such as GSM)–provided that Samsung reciprocally agrees to this same, common royalty base, and same methodological approach to royalty rate, in licensing its declared-essential patents to Apple.”
* Apple estimates that the deal would result in a $.33 per unit royalty for its patents, and vice versa. This is much lower than Samsung’s original request of 2.4% of the average selling price per unit, but Apple says it has yet to see evidence that any company has ever paid that much for a FRAND royalty.
* Either way, the negotiations obviously didn’t make it very far, as Samsung still tried to assert its 3G-related patents against Apple in the trial. The jury, however, would find it not guilty of infringement.
* But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard of the two sides talking over wireless patent licensing, and it probably won’t be the last. Samsung just filed a lawsuit against Apple over the 4G tech it used in the iPhone 5. And thanks to the Nortel auction, Apple has a slew of 4G-related patents to fire back with.
