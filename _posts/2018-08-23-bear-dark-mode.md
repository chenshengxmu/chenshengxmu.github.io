* The freemium Bear app remains one of the most popular writing apps for iOS and macOS thanks to its ease-of-use, customization tools, and flexibility. One of Bear’s most impressive features has always been its use and availability of themes, which can change the mood and color of the app’s text, styling, and background. In this article, you’ll learn how to set Bear’s different themes on both iOS and macOS. 
* The Bear app offers two default themes in the free version, Red Graphite, and High Contrast. These light-colored themes are very similar as you can see below:

* Twelve other themes are available with a Bear Pro subscription, which is priced at $1.49 per month or $14.99 per year. These include a mix of light- and dark-colored themes.

* When choosing a theme, you can also decide to match the app icon with that theme. Additionally, you can choose to include custom icons for tags.

* 3) Finally, select your theme.
* To choose different Bear themes in macOS, do the following:
* 1) When using Bear, select Bear > Preferences from your Mac Toolbar.
* 2) In the pop-up screen, tap Themes at the top.
* 3) Finally, choose your theme.
* In macOS Mojave, which launches this Fall, Apple’s adding an all-new system-wide Dark Mode. Because Apple has released a Dark Mode API, Bear’s expected to adds a theme to match the one from Apple. In a Reddit post, a Bear developer said:
* Is our intention to provide a custom theme following (as much as possible) Apple’s Dark Aqua guidelines. The idea so far is an option to enable or not auto dark mode change when the system switch to dark, this will allow to use other themes when the dark mode is on.
* We’ll update this post when we have more information on Bear’s plans. In the meantime, the app’s Charcoal theme is the one that most closely resembles Apple’s Dark Mode as you can see in the image above.
* You can download the freemium Bear app from both the App Store and Mac App Store.
