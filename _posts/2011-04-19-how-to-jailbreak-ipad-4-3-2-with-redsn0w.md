* Original iPad owners didn’t have much reason to update to the new 4.3.2 firmware released by Apple last week. The upgrade fixed FaceTime issues and the Verizon iPad 2 connectivity problem, but didn’t contain any improvements for 1st generation tablets.
* However if you did update, or would like to, there is a jailbreak available. RedSn0w was recently updated to support the new software. So for folks that have an original iPad on iOS 4.3.2, let me show you how easy it is to jailbreak it.
* This is a simplified tutorial. For a full step by step guide, see the full RedSn0w Tutorial. Just make sure to get the latest version of RedSn0w. This is only for original iPad owners, as there is still no iPad 2 jailbreak available.
* Step 1: Make sure your iPad is on the latest firmware, and that you have the newest version of iTunes.
* Step 2: Download the latest version of RedSn0w (rc14) here. Download it to your desktop to make it easier to find.
* Step 3: Launch the application and follow the on screen instructions, they’re super simple.
* Step 4: After selecting your 4.3.2 firmware and letting the software do its thing, you’ll need to put your iPad into DFU mode. Power + Home button for 10 seconds and then Home button alone for 10 seconds.
* Step 5: If you do this correctly, RedSn0w will work its magic. After it’s done, your iPad will restart and you should see the Cydia icon!
* Any questions?
