* During its big executive shuffle last fall, Apple put expert designer Jony Ive in charge of all HI (Human Interface). And since then, there has been non-stop speculation regarding what kind of changes might be made to the ever-aging iOS.
* And a lot of folks are wondering what the operating system would look like without all of the skeuomorphism — the leather, etc. textures. Well designer Adrian Maciburko might be on the right track with his “Crystal Interface” concept…

* If you recognize the name, it’s because Maciburko has produced a lot of popular concepts over the years, including smart watches and an iPad-based iTV remote. And above are images of his vision (via Cult of Mac) for a cleaner iOS 7.
* Both the Game Center and Notes apps have been redesigned using Maciburko’s “Crystal Interface” concept, which he says tries to find a balance between skeuomorphism-heavy iOS apps and the more digital metro UI of Windows Phone.
* In his explanation of the concept, I think he nails Apple’s biggest challenge in revamping iOS:
* “The idea behind my Crystal Interface concept came from trying to find a balance between current skeuomorphism heavy iOS apps and the more digital metro UI on Windows phone. The challenge was finding a way for the platform to evolve without making drastic changes because it needed to remain familiar to the huge iOS user base.
* I believe a balance between the two directions may be possible. Like Apple focusing on the content and letting hardware fade away into the background, the same needs to happen for the UI.”
* While we tend to write off most concepts because they’re “too far out there,” I think Maciburko’s is tame enough that we could see something similar from Apple in the future. Though its efforts, obviously, would come with a bit more polish.
* What are your thoughts on the above concept?
