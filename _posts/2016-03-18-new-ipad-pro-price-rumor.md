* According to a fresh new rumor based on sources familiar with the matter, Apple’s upcoming iPad model, describes as either a third-generation iPad Air with the A9X chip, Smart Connector and Apple Pencil support or a smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro, is expected to start at $599 for a baseline Wi-Fi-only model with thirty-two gigabytes of storage. In addition, as reported by 9to5Mac, the device should be offered in the same 32/128GB configurations as the iPad Pro.
* By comparison, the baseline iPad Air 2 model with sixteen gigabytes of storage starts at $499. The 32/128GB iPad Pro is $799/$949, or $1,079 for the top-of-the-line 128GB model with Wi-Fi and cellular support.
* The report doesn’t mention a possible price point for a more capacious model with 128GB of storage and the ability to connect to LTE cellular networks.
* “The 9.7-inch iPad Pro model will not replace the iPad Air 2 line, which will remain in Apple’s tablet portfolio for a likely $499 price,” as per 9to5Mac. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the iPad mini 4 won’t be updated at Apple’s event, sources claim.
* Apple is scheduled to hold a media event on Monday, March 21. In addition to a new iPad model, the rumor-mill is expecting a four-inch iPhone SE refresh, new Apple Watch bands and updates to Apple’s operating systems.
