* Good news for folks looking to grab an iPhone 5 for that special someone this Christmas. Now that supply of the handset is finally starting to catch up to demand, RadioShack has decided to put it on sale.
* The retail chain is now taking $20 off Apple’s latest smartphone, dropping the entry-level price to $179 with contract. The discount applies to all AT&T models, including 16GB, 32GB and 64GB versions…
* Electronista was the first to spot the sale, and we’ve since been able to confirm it with a number of RadioShack employees. In fact, it looks like the retailer is also shaving $50 off the 4S as well, making it $50.
* Apple doesn’t typically discount its products, especially current-gen models. And although we’ve seen iPhone sales from carriers and retailers in the past, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on both the 4S and the 5.
* Is this sale going to change your mind if you’ve been holding out on the iPhone 5 due to its price tag? No. But if you’ve been looking at getting one, it’s worth checking out your local RadioShack first. $20 is $20.
* The sale is expected to continue through December 15, and is only for in-store purchases.
