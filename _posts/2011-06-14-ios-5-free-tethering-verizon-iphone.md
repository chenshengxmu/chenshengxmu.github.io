* Here is a new iOS 5 feature that hasn’t been documented yet, most likely because it’s probably a bug that will be taken care of in the next beta release. If you own a Verizon iPhone (aka CDMA version of the iPhone) and you go to Settings > General > Network > Internet Tethering, and turn the toggle ON, you will be able to tether your device for free, turning it into a Wi-Fi hotspot at no charge.
* I don’t have a Verizon iPhone so I couldn’t verify this myself but I asked several people on Twitter and they were all able to turn tethering ON, without having to pay anything to Verizon…
* iDB reader, Joel, who was the first to tip us on that, explains:
* “In iOS 5, as you know, tethering is now an option. On the Verizon wireless build of iOS 5 when you enable tethering you are not charged nor do you have to have a tethering plan. It just works I am using it tethered via bluetooth to my MacBook right now.”
* Verizon normally charges $20/month for 2GB of data for its iPhone tethering plans. It appears that a bug in iOS 5 Beta 1 is going around this and allows native tethering for free.
* Enjoy while it lasts!
* [Thanks everyone for the help]
