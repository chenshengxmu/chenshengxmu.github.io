* Apple has announced that it will be sharing the earnings results for its second fiscal quarter of 2018 on the first of May. The company has scheduled a conference call for Tuesday, May 1 at 5pm ET (2pm PT) to talk about its performance over the past 3 months.
* The second quarter is usually uneventful for Apple, as it follows the typically record-breaking holiday quarter and it rarely sees a major product launch. For some context, the company has provided revenue guidance for the quarter of between $60 and $62 billion.
* At any rate it will be interesting to see where iPhone sales are, given the ongoing rumors that the iPhone X isn’t selling well, as well as what iPad sales look like following last week’s event. We hope you’ll join us here on May 1 as we cover the earnings call live.
