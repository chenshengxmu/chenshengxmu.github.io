* Apple yesterday released a fifth beta of iOS 11 for developer testing, and we’re expecting its matching public beta to drop later today.
* We’re still a few weeks away from iOS 11’s public launch in the fall so we’re not surprised that Apple has been busy squashing bugs and smoothing out the rough edges in the software.
* For instance, the ability for the Messages app to sync your chats across devices through iCloud has been temporarily removed from beta 5.
* Several stock app icons have been redesigned slightly and iOS 11’s much-improved Control Center continues to be refined with functional changes and visual tweaks.
* Without further ado, here’s everything new in iOS 11 beta 5.
* Watch Andrew’s hands-on video covering all the changes in iOS 11 beta 5.

* Aside from the outward-facing changes and important under-the-hood enhancements, iOS 11 beta 5 packs in a bunch of bug fixes listed in Apple’s official release notes.
* Here’s the full list of changes in iOS 11 beta 5 covered in the video.
* Messages
* Camera
* Icon tweaks
* Control Center
* Home screen and Notification Center
* Files app
