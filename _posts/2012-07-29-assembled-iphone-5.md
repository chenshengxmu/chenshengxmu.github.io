* We’ve seen several leaked components over the past few months that are believed to belong to the Apple’s next smartphone. We’ve seen home buttons, front plates, back plates, and more.
* This morning, images surfaced of all of these parts put together, depicting what appears to be a fully-assembled, next-generation iPhone. Keep reading for more details and photos…

* 9to5Mac points to the images, which were published overnight by iLab repair shop. The site has obtained a number of claimed new iPhone parts, including volume switches, a mute switch, a flex cable, and of course, the front and back plates we’ve already seen.

* Put together, everything seems to fit as it should. And the assembled handset lines up perfectly with multiple rumors we’ve heard regarding the next iPhone. It has the relocated FaceTime camera and headphone jack. It has the two-tone backplate, and what appears to be an opening for a smaller dock connector. And it also has a larger display and a thinner profile.

* Of course, there’s no way of confirming that this is what the next iPhone is going to look like. But with the handset already likely in production, you’d think we would have already seen conflicting evidence by now. And we haven’t.
* Apple is widely expected to unveil its new smartphone sometime this fall, in either September or October.
* What do you make of all of this? Is this indeed the next iPhone?
