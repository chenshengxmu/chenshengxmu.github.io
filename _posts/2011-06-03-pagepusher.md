* This is day #2 of Ryan Petrich’s Tweak Week, a friendly challenge that is going to bring us one new tweak a day for 7 days straight. Yesterday Ryan gave us DietBar, and today is coming up with a new tweak called PagePusher.
* PagePusher is a very simple tweak that brings page-styled transitions to your iPhone. It’s not very easy to describe how this app works, so it’s best to just have you watch the video below…

* PagePusher will not add any new icon or even provide options in your Settings app. It is available for free in Cydia. You will first have to add Ryan’s repo, which I’m sure you already have: http://rpetri.ch/repo or it’s usually available in the BigBoss repo shortly after.
* What do you think?
