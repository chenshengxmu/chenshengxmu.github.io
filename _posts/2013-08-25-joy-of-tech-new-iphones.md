title: Joy of Tech has hilarious ideas for new iPhones
---
* Joy of Tech has weighed in on the iPhone 5S/5C memes. As per usual with their illustrations, the comic treads the fine line between poking fun and being downright hilarious. My favorite is their take on the rumored iPhone 5S in gold/champagne color: make it so the gold peels off revealing a layer of chocolate.
* Oh, and the box should include the iGoose, a golden case that lays a golden iPhone and lets you recharge it by “stuffing the phone back up the goose’s butt”.
* I’d hate spoil the fun for you prospective buyers so jump past the fold for the full table…

* Remember just a few weeks ago when the Internet thought all the talk of a plastic iPhone and a gold iPhone 5S colorway was just crazypants analysts speculating?
* To all you Doubting Thomas’s out there, welcome to the new Apple.
* September 10 can’t come soon enough.
* According to iDB’s non-scientific poll of its readers, more than one out of each three respondents would consider a gold color option when upgrading to an iPhone 5S.
