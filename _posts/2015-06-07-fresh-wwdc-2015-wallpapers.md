* Tomorrow, Apple begins the annual Worldwide Developer Conference with a keynote that will be live streamed across le world. A long list of what-if’s shroud the conference this year, with little or no details about any upcoming features or releases. Of course, we expect updates to iOS 9, OS X, and potentially Watch OS. A new Apple Music service will most likely be launched, but less expected is a refresh to Apple TV and a new streaming media service. For full details, make sure to read through Cody’s expansive round up.
* Celebrating the upcoming conference, we previously released a set of wallpapers that were inspired by the WWDC invitations. Today’s selection is a mixture that is inspired both by the invitation and the banners now hanging on San Francisco’s Moscone Center. Step inside to get your new images.
* The first sets of wallpapers are originals by @AR72014, who is well known for his design skills. Immediately below, is a set of wallpapers which are inspired by the banners Apple hung last week at the center for the upcoming conference. They are available with and without the Apple logo. Also linked is the zip file page, which has an individual download for all devices, including multiple desktop sizes.
