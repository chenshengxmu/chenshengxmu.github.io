* Apple on Friday announced that it’s launching a Keyboard Service Program for its MacBook and MacBook Pro lines. The company says it has determined that a small percentage of keyboards within the two lines may be faulty, and it is offering to repair them for free.
* From the support page on Apple’s website:
* Apple has determined that a small percentage of the keyboards in certain MacBook and MacBook Pro models may exhibit one or more of the following behaviors:
* And here the models that are affected:
* If you have one of these models and are experiencing any of these symptoms, Apple or an authorized agent will fix it free. That may involve the replacement of one or more keys, or the whole keyboard, and if you’ve already paid for a repair, Apple will refund you the money.
* Apple’s butterfly keyboards have been divisive amongst customers since they were introduced a few years ago—at first for lack of key travel and tactile feedback, and then for the issues listed above. This is the first time Apple has publicly acknowledged these issues.
* The new program covers eligible MacBook and MacBook Pro models for 4 years after the first retail sale of the unit.
