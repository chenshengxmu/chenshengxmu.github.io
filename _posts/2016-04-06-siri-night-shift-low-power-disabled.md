* The iOS 9.3 software update includes Night Shift mode that helps users get a good night’s sleep by reducing the amount of blue light emitted from a backlight of their iOS device.
* Night Shift is unavailable when an iPhone is in Low Power Mode and a workaround that let you ask Siri to activate Night Shift in this mode no longer works.
* As first reported on by 9to5Mac’s Jeff Benjamin, asking Siri to enable Night Shift while the device is in Low Power Mode now yields a warning message.
* In my tests, asking Siri to please “enable Night Shift mode” produced a response cautioning me that “In order to turn Night Shift, I’ll have to turn off Low Power Mode”.
* The personal digital assistant then offers to do just that.
* Respond with a “yup” and Siri activates Night Shift mode while simultaneously switching Low Power Mode off. It appears that the change is part of a server-side fix.
* Applied this morning, the patch has squashed a bug which, as we detailed previously, let anyone look at the photos and contacts by using Siri on a locked iPhone 6s along with 3D Touch to preview email links in Twitter search results.
