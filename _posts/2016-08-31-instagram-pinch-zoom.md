* Instagram today announced that users of its free of charge iPhone app can now use the familiar pinch-zoom gesture to zoom in on photos—and videos—found in their feed and elsewhere in the app. I’ve long craved for this feature: in fact, I’ve been using iOS’s system-wide Zoom feature to get a closer look at photos in the Instagram app that interest me. Just yesterday, Instagram pushed another update which brings out a new low-light button for its built-in camera.
* “Today we’re bringing zoom to Instagram on iOS,” reads the company’s tweet.
* Instagram specifies that the pinch-zoom gesture can be utilized to zoom on photos and videos in your feed, on user profiles and within the app’s popular Explore tab (which now recommends Stories from people you could follow).
* As for the new low-light feature, you can now capture better photos and videos in the dark as this new button appears automatically when the camera detects darkness.
* The Facebook-owned photo sharing app recently gained a feature that allows you to zoom with one hand as you’re recording a video by sliding your finger up and down while holding the video capture button.
* Grab Instagram for free from the App Store.
