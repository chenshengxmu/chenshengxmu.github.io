* Animated Boot logos can once again be acquired on the latest iOS jailbreaks using a tool from developer iH8sn0w simply called animate fix.
* For example, if you’re an iPhone 4S jailbreaker, all you have to do is download and install the animate fix package, select animated logo from the BootLogo settings panel, and restart your device.
* This is a great way to add even more customization to your iDevice, as you can probably gauge from the screenshots and video…
* Once animate fix is installed on your device, you can choose from over 800+ boot logos available in Cydia by going to Sections > Addons (BootLogo).
* Conveniently, animated logos can also be previewed right from the Settings app, so there’s no need to reboot every time you want to see what your animate logo will look like in action.
* Do you use custom boot logos? If so, which one are you currently using?
