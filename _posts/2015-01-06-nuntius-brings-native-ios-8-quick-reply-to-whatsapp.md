* One of the best things about using the Messages app in iOS 8 is the quick reply interface. Sadly, third party apps don’t have access to the quick reply API, so they are limited in this regard. Wouldn’t it be nice if one of your favorite messaging apps got access to real native iOS 8 quick reply? That’s the exact premise behind Nuntius, a brand new jailbreak tweak that brings true native iOS 8 quick reply to WhatsApp.
* Once you install Nuntius, it just starts working. Obviously you’ll need to have WhatsApp installed and be signed in, but once you do, you’ll see the quick reply interface as soon as you receive a message from a friend.
* There are no options or settings to configure for Nuntius, in fact, there is no preference panel for the tweak to be found in the stock Settings app. This tweak is a true semblance of plug and play.
* If you’re a WhatsApp user, it’s hard to find a reason why you wouldn’t be excited about Nuntius. The tweak is currently in beta now, so it can’t be found on the default Cydia repos, but it can be had by adding the following repo to your list of Cydia sources: http://sharedroutine.com/repo/
* Once you add the repo, simply install the Nuntius package from developer sharedRoutine to begin using it. What do you think about having native iOS 8 quick reply for WhatsApp?
