* While much recent discussion regarding Apple’s guilty verdict on e-book price-fixing charges, we’re now getting the first glimpse at how consumers may benefit. Based on a proposed $162.25 million fund established by the five publishers who earlier settled, consumers could receive up to $3.06 per New York Times bestselling e-book they downloaded to their iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.
* The exact amount depends on whether your purchased e-book was listed on the NYT bestseller list, with a smaller $0.73 disbursed if your e-book did not make it on the list…
* Although Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster have already had their settlement agreements approved by the court, MacMillan and Penguin are waiting for their agreement’s okay, according to MacRumors.
* The two publishers recently emailed consumers regarding the proposal, including offering some information about what sort of refund they might receive. Persons who purchased e-books from Apple’s iBookstore between April 1, 2010 and May 21, 2012 are eligible for the refund.
* According to the official website of the attorneys generals, e-book disbursals will happen depending on which company is involved.
* The amount of your credit or check will be affected by how many qualifying e-books you purchased. There will be two levels of payment, based on categories of e-books. The exact amount to be paid per e-book in each category is not yet finalized.
* That said, based on the plaintiffs proposed plan for a combined fund, these are current estimates:
* • NYT bestsellers: $3.06 per e-book, including titles that were NYT bestsellers at any time, irrespective of when you purchased it • Non-NYT bestsellers: $.73 per e-book, including any titles that were not NYT bestsellers
* Minnesota residents will receive a higher amount because they were not part of the initial round of settlements. Amazon customers will receive the quickest reimbursements, their money automatically added to their account.
* Apple, as well as Barnes & Noble, and Kobo users must activate their account credits, or ask for a check. Objections to the proposed settlements will be heard until October 21. Approval is set for a Dec. hearing.
* As for Apple, the iBookstore firm could owe as much as $500 million.
* A May 2014 court hearing is scheduled to determine Apple’s penalty.
* By the way, if you bought e-books through Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble or Kobo, you were not required to file a claim form to participate in the settlements and will receive an email or postcard notice with information on how to activate your credit.
