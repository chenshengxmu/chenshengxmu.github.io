* Apple on Wednesday updated its GarageBand app for iPhone and iPad on App Store, adding support for the iPhone X screen while implementing new features such as beats sequencer, a sound library for downloading free touch instruments, loops and sound packs, and more.
* For starters, GarageBand 2.3 for iOS now takes full advantage of the Super Retina display on your iPhone X. With an all-new Sound Library feature, users can download additional free instruments, loops and sound packs from within the app.
* For instance, you could play and record using traditional instruments from China and Japan, including the Guzheng, Koto and Taiko drums, available free from the new Sound Library.
* This version of GaragaBand includes three new drummers who play percussion in the styles of pop, songwriter and latin. Another new feature, Beat Sequencer, allows you to build grooves inspired by classic electronic drum machines.
* Pro musicians can now record, mix and export a song at 24-bit audio resolution. And for those of you who use GarageBand on your iPad, you can now take advantage of a larger Audio Unit Extensions view for compatible third-party instruments and effects.
* Last but not least, this edition of GarageBand brings support for expanded sharing and storage options with the Files app in iOS 11 and comes with an iMessage sticker pack that adds GarageBand instrument icons.
* GarageBand for iOS is available free in App Store.
