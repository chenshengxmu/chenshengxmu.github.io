* Yesterday, French blog NowhereElse.fr pointed us to a few curious images of a purported protective case for an ‘iPad Pro,’ originated from a Chinese accessory vendor which makes iPad Air cases.
* The sleek black case clearly shows cutouts for a rear-facing camera, Lightning connector, volume rocker, microphone, mute switch and power button.
* However, the cutouts for stereo speakers believed to be located at the top and bottom of the device are nowhere to be seen. Big media has asserted that the oversized iPad will rock a screen measuring either 12.2 or 12.9 inches and one analyst believes the device may include an optional stylus for the creative types.
* Seen top of post: the size comparison between this case and an iPad Air 2. This should give you good enough indication of the iPad Pro’s assumed form factor and size.
* Here’s our another look at the case.

* Standard caveat applies here: accessory makers often design and manufacture their cases in advance, based on rumors posted online, so you should take this particular leak with a few pinches of salt.

* Earlier this month, NowhereElse published images of an alleged iPad Pro protective case mold. As shown below, there are four speaker cutouts — consistent with the rumor-mill’s prediction of enhanced speakers on the device for stereo sound in any orientation.

* Recently, 9to5Mac learned that Apple is now threatening legal action for accessory makers which leak out information about future devices.
* “Should Apple find that, prior to the release of a product, you have sought, obtained, or relied upon specifications of that product from sources other than Apple, Apple may choose to exercise its right to take action against you, which penalties can include, but are not limited to, Apple choosing not to stock your product in our stores,” reads a part of the company’s agreement forced upon accessory makers who risk losing “future business opportunities that Apple and/or its affiliates may present to you” as a potential consequence of violating or not signing the document.
* If today’s leak is an indication, Apple’s agreement has anything but stopped the proliferation of third-party cases for Apple’s unannounced iPad Pro.
