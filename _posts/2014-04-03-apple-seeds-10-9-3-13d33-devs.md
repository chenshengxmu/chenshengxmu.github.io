* Apple has seeded another beta for OS X 10.9.3 to registered Mac developers this afternoon. The update comes one week after it released the third beta of 10.9.3, which added various improvements.
* The new beta build is available to registered Mac developers through the Software Update tab in the Mac App Store, or as a complete download via the Mac section of Apple’s online developer portal…
* We’ve seen a number of enhancements in 10.9.3 thus far, including the addition of a new native ‘Retina’ resolution option for 4K displays and the restoration of the ability to sync contacts and calendar info.
* There’s no word on when the update will be released to the public, but it can’t be too far off. Today’s build is labeled 13D33, and we’ll be sure to let you know if it includes any features or changes worth note.
