* Apple has released a Supplemental Update to OS X 10.8.5. The release fixes an issue with the FaceTime HD camera on late-model MacBook Airs, a bug that caused external drives to be ejected, and other problems.
* Additionally, Apple has also seeded a new version of iTunes this afternoon, bringing the app to version 11.1.1. The update doesn’t offer up any new features, but it does bring about bug fixes and stability improvements…
