* Variety reports that three Amazon Studios executives have jumped ship and taken up new positions at Apple in an effort to bolster their original video content.
* The three executives include Tara Sorensen, Carina Walker and Tara Pietri.
* Sorensen will lead children’s programming at Apple, which is similar to her position at Amazon. She will also be reporting to Apple’s chief content officers Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, who Apple previously poached from Sony.
* Pietro will also take on a familiar role, leading Apple’s legal affairs division as she did with Amazon.
* Apple’s video division has been busy lately landing several high-profile projects. We have the sci-fi drama series from Ronal D. Moore (a Star Trek veteran), the reboot of Steven Spielberg’s “Amazing Stories”, and a new drama starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston set behind the scenes of a morning show.
* Fingers crossed these renewed efforts fair better than Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke that were overall poorly received.
