* Apple’s next-generation full-sized iPad is expected to sport a redesigned casing, similar to that of the iPad mini. It’s said to be lighter and thinner than the iPad 4, with an overall smaller footprint.
* And a new video surfaced this weekend that gives us a good idea of just how much the two tablets will differ in size, by comparing the measurements of an alleged iPad 5 shell with its predecessor…
* The video comes from Chinese parts supplier sw-box.com (via MacRumors):
* The narrative for the fifth gen iPad has been set for several months now. We first started seeing purported shell leaks back in January, and not much has changed since then through dozens of reports.
* In addition to the iPad mini-like redesign, the tablet is expected to feature a variation of Apple’s 64-bit A7 processor, 2GB of RAM, and three color options including silver, gold, and the new space gray.
* Last week, alleged photos of a gold iPad mini with Touch ID Home button surfaced.
