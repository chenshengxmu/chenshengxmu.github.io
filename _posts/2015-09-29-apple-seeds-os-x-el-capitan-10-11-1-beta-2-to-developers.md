* Apple just seeded OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 beta 2 to developers. It follows up its release of OS X 10.11.1 beta 1 back on September 17. The timing for the new beta release is of interest, as Apple is planning on dropping the public version of the free OS X 10.11 El Capitan software update tomorrow.
* According to the official release notes, this beta offers stability, compatibility and security improvements.
* The pre-release software also contains support for Unicode 8 and new emojis that made an appearance in the first beta of OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 and are part of iOS 9. We’ll update this post with more changes as we encounter them.
* OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 beta 2 is available through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store for those who have the previous beta installed and as a standalone download in the Apple Developer Center.
