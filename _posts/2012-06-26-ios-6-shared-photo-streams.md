* Shared Photo Streams is a new feature in iOS 6 that allows you to selectively share photo albums with friends and family of your choosing. Unlike the My Photo Stream feature which is geared only towards individual photo sharing amongst iOS devices and computers owned by you, Shared Photo Streams brings a social element to iOS photography.
* The streaming element comes from the fact that you can dynamically add or remove photos from a shared album and they will almost instantaneously appear or disappear on demand. Album viewers can also comment and like your photos, and you will receive push notifications any time someone does so.
* Take a look at our full video walkthrough above for a look into how Shared Photo Streaming works.
* Will you use Shared Photo Streams, or will you stick to more “traditional” photo sharing via Facebook and Instagram?
