* If you thought the iPhone X notch was hideous, wait ’till you see Google’s upcoming third-generation Pixel smartphone. According to a new leak Wednesday, Pixel 3 XL could feature a really tall notch at the top of the display as well as a huge bezel at the bottom.
* Android Police today shared images and videos allegedly showing a pre-release version of the phone, originally posted by a Ukrainian technology blogger on his Telegram channel. The leak suggests that Pixel 3 XL should use the recently released Android 9 Pie software and be powered by Qualcomm’s 8-core 845 processor paired with Adreno 630 graphics.

* The specs sheet indicates that the smartphone comes outfitted with 4GB of RAM while the display has a resolution of 1,440-by-2,960 pixels with a pixel density of 494 PPI. The unboxing images reveal what appears to be a pretty new iPhone-like wallpaper.
* As mentioned, the device has a noticeably taller notch than iPhone X. It’s unclear if the Pixel 3 XL notch was designed to house a sophisticated infrared depth camera system like the iPhone X notch or if mimicking Apple’s design is the only real purpose it serves.
* Here’s the unboxing video.
* What’s up with the huge bezel at the bottom?
* Bloomberg says that Google aims to eventually completely remove the bezels in a future Pixel, “but is retaining the notch and chin this year to keep stereo speakers on the front of the phone.”

* Packaging indicates the phone ships bundled with wired USB-C earphones that resemble Pixel Buds, along with a charging brick, a charging cable and a dongle to let customers connect their existing 3.5mm headphones to the phone’s USB-C port.

* The rumor-mill thinks that 2018’s Pixel lineup will offer a smaller, notch-less 5.4-inch Pixel 3 model and the larger 6.2-inch Pixel 3 XL featuring an iPhone X-like notch.
* If history is an indication, Google will hold its even in October after Apple shows off its 2018 iPhone portfolio and reveals other updates in September.
* What do you make of Pixel 3 XL?
* How about that huge bezel at the bottom? And what are your views on the worrying trend that has emerged in the Android camp of copying Apple’s iPhone X notch design?
