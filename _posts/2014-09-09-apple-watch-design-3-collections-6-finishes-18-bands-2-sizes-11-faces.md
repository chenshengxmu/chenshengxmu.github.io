* The Apple Watch is as much about individuality and customizability as it is about technology. Tim Cook and company proudly showcased the many customization options available for the Apple Watch, and it is quite impressive.
* Whereas other wearable have launched with perhaps a handful of self-identifying options, the Apple Watch features a gaggle of possible combinations. It’s quite possible that everyone in your circle could buy an Apple Watch, and all of them would look vastly different.
* The Apple Watch comes in 3 collections, 6 different finishes, a plethora or bands, two sizes, and nearly a dozen faces. Its a mix and matcher’s dream, and certainly one of its biggest selling points. Check inside, as we break down all that the Apple Watch has to offer when it comes to personalization.
* To start, the Apple Watch comes available in three different collections. The collections are as follows:

* The Apple Watch
* The Apple Watch is the basic style of Apple Watch, a baseline, if you will. The standard Apple Watch comes with highly polished scratch-resistant stainless steel and a space black stainless steel case. The watch’s display is covered in sapphire crystal for added protection. There are 18 different models in the Apple Watch collection.

* The Apple Watch Sport
* The Apple Watch Sport is for the more active user. Its cases are fashioned out of lightweight anodized aluminum in silver and space gray. The display one-up’s the standard Apple Watch display when it comes to durability, as it is protected by strengthened Ion-X glass. There are 10 different models in the Apple Watch Sport collection.

* Apple Watch Edition in 18-Karat Yellow Gold
* Lastly, the Apple Watch Edition caters to the business professional, or at least, those who care most about style and grace. The Apple Watch Edition will likely be the most pricey of all of the Apple Watches available, seeing that it comes wrapped in a case crafted from 18-karat gold, which has been developed to be up to twice as hard as standard gold. Like the standard Apple Watch, the Edition comes covered with polished sapphire crystal. The Apple Watch Edition will be available in both yellow and rose gold colors.
* The Apple Watch comes in a total of six different finishes.

* Finishes include stainless steel, aluminum, and gold, and each finish comes in two styles. The different finishes, a total of six, are as follows:
* Stainless steel: Standard, and Space Black
* Aluminum: Silver, and Space Gray
* Gold: 18K Yellow Gold, and Rose Gold
* The stainless steel finish is available on the standard Apple Watch, while the anodized aluminum is relegated to the Apple Watch Sport. Finally, as one would expect, the Apple Watch Edition, with its pricey appearance, uses the gold finishes.
* The Apple Watch comes with a whole host of different bands, allowing wearers to assert individuality. The bands are special because they require no finagling to change them out and replace then with other bands. Each band has been created from a variety of materials for a truly personal look.

* The bands include the following six styles, and outside of the Milanese Loop, each features multiple color options.
* Sport Bands:
* Classic Buckle
* Milanese Loop
* Modern Buckle:
* Leather Loop
* Link Bracelet
* The Apple Watch comes in two face sizes—a 38mm version, and a slightly larger 42mm version.

*  
* Women traditionally wear watches that are smaller than men’s watches, so this should ensure that there is a watch that works with everyone’s style on launch day.
* Finally, the Apple Watch comes with a variety of different watch faces. These watch faces are of the digital variety, and can be changed on a whim via its software.

* There are 11 faces to choose from, and the faces include the following choices:
* The Chronograph watch face is the more traditional looking face, while you can assign a photo, or perhaps a slideshow to the Photo watch face.
* So, in a nutshell, there are two different face sizes, three different collections, six types of finishes, a dozen and a half bands to choose from, and eleven different watch faces! I don’t think there’s any question that the Apple Watch, from day one, features many more personalization options than any of its competitors. What say you?
