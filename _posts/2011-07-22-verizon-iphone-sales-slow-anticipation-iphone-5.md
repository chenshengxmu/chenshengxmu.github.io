* Verizon Wireless has released its earnings report for the third business quarter of 2011, with a reported 2.3 million iPhones activated on its CDMA network. The iPhone 4 came out on Verizon back in Feburary, and Verizon’s sales numbers have been trailing behind AT&T’s ever since.
* In Q3, AT&T activated 3.6 million iPhones. Together, AT&T and Verizon only account for 30% of the 20 million iPhones Apple shipped last quarter, with AT&T still being the preferred carrier for new iPhone customers…
* A reason that AT&T’s numbers are still stronger could be the fact that Verizon only offers the iPhone 4, while AT&T offers the iPhone 4 and 3GS. Lots of consumers still opt for the cheaper, $50 iPhone 3GS on AT&T. The numbers from Q3 reflect that AT&T isn’t suffering at all from the end of its exclusivity agreement with Apple.
* AT&T saw a decrease in iPhone sales last quarter as well, and slowed sales on both carriers point to the fact that people are waiting for Apple’s next iPhone model. In fact, according to Phone Arena, Verizon is trying to clear out its iPhone 4 accessory inventory in anticipation of the iPhone 5’s launch.
* Are you waiting for the iPhone 5 on Verizon?
