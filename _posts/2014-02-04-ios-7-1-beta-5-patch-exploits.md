* Shortly after iOS 7.1 beta 4 was released, we learned that the update patched a key kernel exploit used in the evasi0n7 jailbreak. And today weâ€™ve received word that beta 5, which was seeded to developers earlier this afternoon, patches 2 other exploits.
* Developer and hacker iH8sn0w tweeted out a few moments ago that Apple has fixed the â€˜chownâ€™ vulnerability and â€˜afc sandbox escapeâ€™ used by the evad3râ€™s popular jailbreak utility in beta 5. So it looks like iOS 7.1 will indeed be the death of the iOS 7 JBâ€¦
* Here are the tweets:
* Apple fixed the chown vuln that appeared in iOS 7 (http://t.co/65wfTkCKML) and used by evasi0n7 by checking to see if its a symlink again ðŸ˜›

* evasi0n7â€™s afc sandbox escape is patched in 7.1b5 too.

* While we havenâ€™t received official word from the evad3rs that evasion7 will be completely killed by iOS 7.1, we do advise jailbreakers to assume it does and take the proper precautions such as updating your device to iOS 7.0.4/5 and staying away from 7.1 betas.
* The good news, though, is that the future looks bright for jailbreaking beyond iOS 7.1. The evad3rs claim to still have some unused exploits up their sleeves, and earlier this week iH8sn0w found anÂ iBoot exploit for A5 devices that may work for A6 and 7 as well.
