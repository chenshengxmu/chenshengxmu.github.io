* Getting a ticket into WWDC is increasingly becoming akin to winning a lottery. And with tickets to this year’s conference selling out in under two minutes, and only five thousand of $1,599 seats available, Apple’s annual pilgrimage for developers is quickly becoming too crowded a place. Enter #AltWWDC, a free and open five-day alternative to Apple’s summer event.
* Basically the conference that happens outside the conference, #AltWWDC takes place June 10-14, 2013 at the San Francisco State University’s Downtown Campus at 845 Market Street, only a block from the Moscone building…
* Their blurb:
* Five days of talks, food, co-working, and mingling with other developers all without the bar noise. Got a WWDC ticket? Didn’t get a WWDC ticket? Doesn’t matter – the conference happens outside the conference.
* With free lunch everyday, Wi-Fi access and coffee machines all over the place, the event promises to become the mingling place for those unfortunate developers who couldn’t secure their WWDC ticket.
* The #AltWWDC organizers – Appsterdam, a non-profit by app makers, for app makers – also confirmed a list of speakers, which include Mike Lee, Victor Agreda, Jr., Brett Terpstra, Brent Simmons, Saul Mora and many others.
* There will be a keynote breakfast on Monday, June 10, 2013 between 10:00am and 12:00pm where visitors will get to watch live WWDC streams “as we catch up on the news and events coming out of the WWDC keynote.”
