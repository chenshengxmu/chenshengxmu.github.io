* After keeping mum on the title for nearly a year, Gameloft has finally started talking about Modern Combat 5 this month. We now know that it’s called ‘Blackout,’ we know about the storyline, and we know about some of its features, like unified progression system.
* Today, the studio posted more details regarding the game, saying that it will offer a new ‘Squad vs. Squad’ multiplayer mode, limited-time  gaming events, and more. It also shared a couple new high resolution in-game screenshots, which we’ve posted for you below…

* Gameloft says that Modern Combat 5: Blackout will be made up of four main multiplayer modes: Capture The Flag, VIP, Free for All and Team Battle. Squad vs. Squad takes it to the next level, allowing you to join squads with your friends to compete against others.
* MC5 will bring competitive team battles to the next level, with persistent squads formed by players. You can join squads with your friends or any other player you meet online, then take your squad online against other squads from around the world. Strategy and team balancing will be key, and players within a squad will have their own dedicated squad chat to talk to each other and plan their tactics. There is also a global chat function which allows you to talk to anyone. 
* Modern Combat 5 is expected to be one of the biggest mobile game releases of the year, and those who have gotten a chance to play it have sung its praises. TouchArcade said that the game plays a lot like its popular predecessor, except the graphics are noticeably better.
* There’s still no word on when MC5 : Blackout is going to be released, but given Gameloft’s recent uptick in press releases, we imagine it’s not too far away. We should learn more about the game at E3 (the Electronic Entertainment Expo) in Los Angeles next month.
