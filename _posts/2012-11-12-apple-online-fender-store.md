* With the holidays just around the corner, Apple has been seen stocking up on app-enabled accessories. A few weeks ago we noted that the iPad-maker had started selling iPhone-controlled lightbulbs, and now it’s added an iOS-friendly guitar to its inventory.
* Fender, a long-time legend in the guitar business, has created a custom version of its popular Squier Stratocaster guitar with built-in USB and iOS connectivity. This means that you can plug into anything from a complex digital studio, to your iPad, and rock out…
* Some of the guitar’s features include:
* You can use the Squier as a standard guitar, or, with the included cables, you can use it to record audio straight to your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Unfortunately there’s no Lightning interface, so new iDevice owners will have to shell out an extra $30 for an adapter.
* If you’re interested, you can find the Squier by Fender USB Stratocaster Guitar in Apple’s web store (there’s no word if it’s in retail stores yet) for $199.95. We could certainly think of worse things you could find to spend $200.
* What do you think?
