* The first official trailer for Ashton Kutcher’s ‘Jobs’ was finally released today, giving the general public its first glimpse at the movie. We saw a snippet of the film earlier this year, when it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, but it never really made it beyond the tech world.
* ‘Jobs’ has had an interesting year thus far. After receiving mixed reviews at Sundance, the film’s April release date was canceled and the project was shelved. Then, earlier this month, we learned it would finally be hitting theaters in August. So without further ado, here’s your trailer…
* This particular film, which stars Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs and Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak, is one of 3 Jobs-related films in the books this year. Back in April, Funny or Die released the controversial ‘iSteve’ comedy flick, and Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin is still working on his script.
* Sorkin’s movie, which is backed by Sony Pictures and has the rights to Jobs’ biography by Walter Isaacson, is easily the most anticipated of the 3. Last fall, he said the film will likely consist of three scenes showing Jobs backstage prior to the launches of the Mac, NeXT, and the iPod.
* I have to say, this new trailer for Kutcher’s Jobs movie is actually quite good. What do you think?
