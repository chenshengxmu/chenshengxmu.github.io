* SafariTabCount is a just released jailbreak tweak that displays the current number of open tabs on the new tab button in Safari. This tweak is extremely useful, because without it, you have no idea how many tabs you have open in Safari without opening the list of tabs and counting by hand.
* Not too long ago, we had iOS 6, and Safari for iOS 6 included the open tab count right on the new tab button. For some reason, Apple deemed this tab count disposable, and got rid of it in iOS 7.
* SafariTabCount is one of those tweaks that I imagine many people will enjoy for its practicality. Check out of video walkthrough past the break for more details.
* There are no options to configure or settings to adjust for SafariTabCount, it’s an install and go affair. If you want to give SafariTabCount a try, then venture over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo where it can be downloaded free of charge.
* SafariTabCount is an iOS 7 only jailbreak tweak, and it only works with the stock Safari browser. If you decide to use it, then please let us know what you think about the tweak in the comments section.
