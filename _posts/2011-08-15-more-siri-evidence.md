* When it comes to iOS 5, Apple has some serious tricks up its sleeve. Though killer features like voice-to-text and Assistant weren’t mentioned in Apple’s WWDC keynote on the new firmware, they’re there.
* From what we know so far, the voice-to-text implementation is pretty straightforward. It appears to be system-wide and powered by Nuance technology. The Assistant feature on the other hand, has been a bit of a mystery. Until now…
* Most of you know by now that Apple acquired a company named Siri last year. The start-up firm had developed an interesting iOS application called Siri Assistant that used Nuance voice recognition technology to understand and respond to a long list of voice commands.
* The application covered everything from sending emails to adding new calendar dates. It could even book your dinner reservations through services like OpenTable — all via voice commands. So what will the Siri-based feature in iOS 5 look like?
* 9to5Mac published a screenshot of files found buried in iOS 5 that suggest that the Siri implementation in Apple’s new firmware will “closely mirror” the iOS app. The service will be able to tap into a list of stock applications, including the address book and the calendar.

* Obviously, since Apple has yet to make an official announcement regarding the hidden Assistant feature, don’t bet the farm on seeing it this Fall. But it certainly looks like they’re building a component that will allow users to completely control their devices, simply by talking to them.
* Are you hoping for the Assistant feature this Fall?
