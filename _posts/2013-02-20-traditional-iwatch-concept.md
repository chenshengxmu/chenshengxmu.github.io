* As reports claiming that Apple is working on a wristwatch-like device continue to swirl, and subsequent speculation grows, concept artists have taken to their digital palettes to create their own versions of the so-called ‘iWatch.’
* We’ve already seen a handful of these Apple-watch mockups—most of which feature curved glass displays and futuristic designs. But today, we’ve come across a concept that takes a far more traditional wristwatch approach…
* The renders come from Nickolay Lamm over at MyVoucherCodes. He says the watch itself is designed after Ikepod‘s Geneve Horizon watches, a known favorite of Jony Ive, who also happens to be friends with the creator.

* The UI you see on the watch’s face is inspired by a 2010 patent for a strange spiral iTunes interface. Apple has obviously not utilized the patent yet, but Lamm feels that it could really benefit the iWatch—like the Click Wheel did for the iPod.
* We’ve heard several reports over the past few weeks regarding Apple’s secret wristwatch project. Bloomberg says it has a team of over 100 designers working on it, and The Wall Street Journal claims it’s already testing designs with Foxconn.
* In fact, by all accounts, it sounds like the company is moving forward with iWatch plans. And wouldn’t you know it, Samsung is also said to be working on a smartwatch of its own. It’ll sure be interesting to see this space in another 6 months.
* What do you think of this iWatch concept?
