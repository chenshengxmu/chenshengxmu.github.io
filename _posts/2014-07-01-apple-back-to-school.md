* As predicted, Apple on Tuesday launched the 2015 Back to School promotion in the United States and in several countries around the globe, depending on their respective educational calendars.
* Somewhat similar to last year’s Back to School promotion, Apple this year is providing students with a $100 Gift card with the purchase of any new Mac model.
* Students who opt for an iPhone or iPad will be treated to a free $50 Apple Store gift card. However, this is the first time that Apple’s Back to School promotion is offering gift cards, redeemable against any Apple Store item purchase…
* Previously, Apple offered iTunes gift cards redeemable against app, movie, music and book purchases on iTunes.
* Now live at the Online Apple Store in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and across a few key markets in Europe, the promotion gives students a free $100 Apple Store Gift Card with the purchase of a qualifying Mac (the Mac mini excepted) for college.
* A free $50 gift card is available when buying an iPad or iPhone.
* Eligible iPhone and iPad models include the fourth-generation iPad, iPad Air, iPad mini with Retina display, iPad mini, iPhone 4s, iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s. The company also offers education pricing on Macs and iPads where applicable.
* The promotion is valid starting today and until September 9. The official terms and conditions are available in Apple’s PDF document.
