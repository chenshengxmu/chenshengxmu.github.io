* It’s been a quite week for the jailbreak community, but amid the recent demo showcasing the first-known jailbreak for the iPhone X, there’s renewed hope that hackers are still working on a tool compatible with iOS 11.
* While Cydia hasn’t been too crazy in recent weeks, there have still been a few jailbreak tweaks released this week that are worth mentioning. In this roundup, we’ll give you a closer look at this week’s releases.
* This week’s jailbreak tweak offerings seemed to pick on the Instagram app more than anything, but for jailbreakers who enjoy sharing their photos and videos with the world, that could be a good thing. Check them out below:

* Have you ever wanted the ability to download Instagram images directly from your Instagram feed before? We certainly have.
* Instagram Down Image is a new free jailbreak tweak that lets you do just that. It adds a new button to the bottom-right of every image in your Instagram feed that can save images to your Camera Roll with just a tap. A friendly heads-up display even lets you know when saving the image succeeded.
* You can learn more about Instagram Down Image in our full review, where we go hands-on with the tweak.

* If you hate seeing the banner at the top of your Instagram app every time you take a screenshot from within the app, then you might like a new free tweak called ShyInstaShot.
* Installing this tweak prevents the bothersome screenshot-sharing banner from appearing. Instead, you can now take screenshots in peace, saving images to your Camera Roll just as you intended.
* While Instagram had good intentions behind the screenshot-sharing banner, its options are limited. With it, you can only share to Twitter, Facebook, and copy a link to the Instagram post to your clipboard. In all honesty, screenshotting your Instagram feed, so you have the raw image in your Camera Roll still reigns supreme.

* While that brings this week’s roundup to a close, Monday will kick off new week for Cydia and jailbreak tweak releases. There are some exciting new projects under development, and we can’t wait to share them with you. Stay tuned to iDB, so you stay up to date with all of the latest jailbreak news.
