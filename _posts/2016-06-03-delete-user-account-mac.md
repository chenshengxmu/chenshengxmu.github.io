* When you’ve got multiple people using the same Mac, having more than one user account can be really useful for keeping everyone’s files and apps separated from one another and adding a layer of privacy and security between users.
* On the other hand, when you no longer have more than one user for your Mac, or you don’t want someone using your computer anymore, it’s also possible to remove a user account from your Mac.
* We’ll show you how in this simple, step-by-step tutorial.
* So you’ve decided it’s time to remove someone’s access to your computer… well you’ve come to the right place.
* Removing a user account is useful not only when you want to revoke someone’s access to the computer, but also when you have just made a user account on your own to test something out and then later decide you don’t need it anymore.
* You will want to make a backup of any important files or apps that may be present on the user account, because when you proceed with this tutorial, you’ll be deleting everything that was previously stored on that user account from your Mac for good.
* If you’re ready, you can move on immediately…
* To remove a user account you’ve made, you’ll need to be an administrator of your Mac; this means you should log in to the administrator account. If you’re unable to, you’ll have to get in touch with the computer administrator to move on.
* If you’re logged in to an administrator account, you can follow these steps to remove a user account from your Mac:
* 1) Open the System Preferences app and then go to the Users & Groups preferences pane.

* 2) Next, you’ll click on the Lock button at the bottom of the Users & Groups preferences pane to unlock it.

* 3) Enter your administrator password when prompted, then click the blue Unlock button.

* 4) Once you’re in, select the user account from the list at the left side of the window that you want to remove. In this case, we’re deleting the standard user iDownloadBlog. Then, click on the – button at the bottom of the account selection list.

* 5) Confirm that you wish to delete the home folder for the account you’re deleting by selecting the last option in the prompt that appears, then click on the blue Delete User button.

* And that’s all there is to it! Now that user account is long gone, and you’ve locked out that person’s access to your Mac.
* If you ever need to give that person access to your Mac again, you will need to create a brand new user account.
* All of the files, settings, and apps that were previously on the Mac’s user account you removed were wiped from your storage drive when you deleted the user account. This means they’ll need to use a backup they created to put it all back, unless you made a backup yourself before deleting the account.
* On the other hand, if you have a user account doing nothing but taking up space because it’s never used, then this is a great way to free up some much-needed storage space.
* Now that you know how to delete a user account, you’re one step closer to being a Mac expert. Stay tuned for additional Mac guides tailored for both beginner and advanced users, only on iDB!
