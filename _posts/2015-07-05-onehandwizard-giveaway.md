* As an owner of a larger iPhone, OneHandWizard ($3.99) is one of my favorite jailbreak tweaks on Cydia. It allows you to quickly switch to a one-handed mode that’s far and away more practical than the built in Reachability feature on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
* Earlier this year, we reviewed OneHandWizard, and it was met with high praise. It may seem like a simple thing, but if you’re on a larger device like the 6 and 6 Plus, and you haven’t tried it, I think you’re missing out.
* But don’t fret. Here’s your chance to see what you’ve been missing. We’re giving away 10 copies of OneHandWizard to our readers!
* We’re going to keep this simple for you guys. To enter to win, just do the following:
* Step 1: Follow @iDownloadBlog on Twitter
* Step 2: Leave a comment below with your Twitter handle and your Cydia ID
* To find your Cydia ID, launch Cydia, tap the Cydia tab, and tap Manage Account. Login, and you should see your Cydia Account #.
* So here is an example of what your entry should look like:
* Twitter: @JeffBenjam
* Cydia: 123456789
* Special thanks to @TheAfricanNerd and @SharedRoutine, the folks responsible for OneHandWizard, for offering these copies to our readers.
* Winners will be selected at random and announced on Wednesday’s Let’s Talk Jailbreak podcast. Stay tuned!
* Update: Here are the winners
