* The popular Photoshop alternative, Pixelmator, on Tuesday refreshed its iPhone, iPad and iPod touch application on the App Store, bringing out two desktop-class tools—Magnetic Selection and Quick Selection—along with numerous selection improvements and a bunch of fixes for the Apple Pencil, the iPhone version of the app and more. The Smart Selection and Magnetic Selection tools first appeared in Pixelmator for Mac in May 2016.
* “Pixelmator 2.3 for iOS brings an incredible Quick Selection Tool, a powerful and precise Magnetic Selection Tool, features many small, but awesome improvements to the selection experience on iOS, and more,” developers noted.
* With the new Magnetic Selection tool in Pixelmator 2.3 for iOS, you can easily select complex objects quickly and precisely. Simply trace the edges of any object in your image and watch the tool automatically snap an accurate selection around that object.
* With the all-new Quick Selection tool in Pixelmator 2.3 for iOS, you can make incredibly accurate selections by simply swiping over areas in your image. After choosing the Magnetic Selection tool, simply start your selection by swiping over the edge of an object you want to select. As you move your finger, the tool automatically snaps around the object, making precise object selection ridiculously easy.
* Here’s everything new, fixed and improved in Pixelmator 2.3 for iOS:
* This update is free for existing users of the app.
* The full release notes can be found at pixelmator.com/ios/updates.
* Grab Pixelmator for $4.99 from the App Store.
* Pixelmator for Mac is $29.99 on the Mac App Store.
