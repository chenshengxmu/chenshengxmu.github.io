* Twitter, the popular micro-blogging service, is rolling out a brand new profile experience on Twitter for iPhone, in addition to another cool new feature — support for interactive notifications for incoming tweets on iOS 8 devices — the startup announced in a blog post Thursday.
* While the new profiles will be available for everyone using iOS 7 or above, the ability to interact with alerts on the Lock and Home screen is not because this capability is part of the great new features available only in iOS 8.
* Twitter’s interactive notifications on iOS 8 allow you to retweet, favorite, follow and more.
* You can interact with incoming alerts by swiping down on the banner anywhere on your iPhone, or directly on the Lock screen — if you have iOS 8, of course.
* My only gripe with this feature is the fact that these interactions are actually simple shortcuts to a tweet or a profile inside the Twitter app so you can’t really reply to a tweet from the notification without being taken to the reply screen in Twitter for iPhone.
* Here’s a look at interactive notifications in Twitter, via MacStories editor Federico Viticci.

* As for Twitter’s “biggest update to profiles to date”, the changes the team has made mostly focus on your bio, tweets and photos, as seen below. I must admit I’m really liking the new-look profiles. Not only is the new design much easier on the eyes on a tiny smartphone screen, I also get to see more of what matters to me about a person when I’m checking out their bio page.

* Previously, you had to swipe on the profile page to access stuff like the timelines for Tweets, photos and favorites, but not anymore. Here, check out the Twitter-provided animated GIF below which highlights some of the marque new features of its revamped profiles.

* The new buttons for tweets, favorites and photos on a person’s profile page are really helpful, especially combined with an endlessly scrolling feed in each section.
* ”Featuring a fresh design, the updated profiles focus on your bio, Tweets and photos, making it easy for you to get a glimpse into the people you care about on Twitter,” wrote the firm.
* It wasn’t unfortunately immediately clear when these cool new features might trickle down to Twitter for iPad.
* Twitter has been testing a Buy button in tweets (not to be confused with the #AmazonCart functionality) and ‘Promoted Video’ advertisements in timelines for months now. And just recently, the startup has implemented support for animated GIFs on both Twitter.com and in the iOS apps.
* Twitter for iPhone is available free in the App Store.
