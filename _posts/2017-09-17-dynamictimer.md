* Anyone who uses the timer in iOS knows that it’s useful for one of two things: 1) to count down for something special, or 2) to make your music playback stop after a designated amount of time.
* If you use your iOS timer for both cases mentioned above frequently, then it can be cumbersome to switch back and forth between your favorite sound and the “Stop Playing” option for each situation. Fortunately, a new free jailbreak tweak called DynamicTimer by iOS developer KingPuffdaddi helps automate this process.
* Once installed, iOS timers become more intelligent, detecting whether music is playing at any given time and acting accordingly. With no options to configure, the tweak is very straightforward to use.
* If music is playing when your timer goes off, then DynamicTimer automatically overrides your timer sound setting and switches it to “Stop Playing.” Alternatively, if your music isn’t playing when a timer goes off, then the timer sound you configured previously will play as expected.
* DynamicTimer equates to time savings for timer power-users; on the other hand, whether you need it or not boils down to how you use the timer functionality in iOS. Because everyone’s different and uses the timer functionality for various purposes, your mileage may vary from mine or the next guy.
* If you happen to fall asleep listening to soothing music or you have a reason to play your songs for only a set duration of time, then this tweak might be worth considering because it makes things more convenient; if you don’t, then you probably don’t need it.
* DynamicTimer is a free download from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices. Kudos go to Reddit user Asohailwahab for coming up with the idea behind the tweak.
