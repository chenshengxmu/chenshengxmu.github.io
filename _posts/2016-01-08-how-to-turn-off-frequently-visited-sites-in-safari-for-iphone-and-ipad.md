* Safari on the iPhone and iPad sports a panel that opens when you touch the browser’s address bar. From there, you can access websites that you’ve saved as your Favorites, right at the top, as well as those that you visit most often listed in a section below, headlined Frequently Visited.
* For privacy and other reasons, you may want to avoid seeing a list of frequently visited websites every time you tap Safari’s combined search/URL field. This quick tutorial will introduce you to a Safari switch in Settings that lets you show or hide frequently visited sites.
* Step 1: Launch Settings on your iOS device.
* Step 2: Now tap on Safari.
* Step 3: Flip the Frequently Visited Sites switch under the General heading to the OFF position.

* This will prevent sites you frequent most from being listed when you touch Safari’s address field. For comparison’s sake, here’s what the interface looks like with frequently-visited sites enabled, at left, and turned off, at right.
