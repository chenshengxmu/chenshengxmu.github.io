* Google acquired Quickoffice, a mobile software suite that includes word processor, spreadsheet and presentation apps—all compatible with MS Office, last summer. And in December it released a free Quickoffice iPad app for its Google Apps for Business customers.
* Today, it’s updated that app with better Google Drive storage integration and, more importantly, support for the iPhone. So if you’re a Google Apps for Business subscriber, you can now create, edit and view Word, Excel and PowerPoint files on your Apple handset…
* Here’s the full changelog for today’s update:
* -Now designed for both iPhone and iPad -Sort Google Drive files by Shared with me, Starred, and Recent -Support for multiple Google Drive accounts -Improved chart rendering in Quicksheet and Quickpoint -Create and share ZIP folders from multiple files -Bug fixes and performance enhancement
* In addition to bringing Quickoffice to the iPhone, Google also improved the app’s support for Google’s Drive storage service. It’s easier to find and use your Drive files from within the app, as the Folders view now includes Shared With Me, Starred, Recent and subfolders.
* To reiterate, this app is only available for Google Apps for Business subscribers, a service that starts at $5 a month or $50 a year. If you’re not a subscriber, you’ll want to check out apps like Quickoffice Pro or Pro HD. Though at $14.99, they’re a bit on the pricey side.
* But if you do pay for Google’s Apps for Business service, you’ll definitely want to grab the latest version of Quickoffice, which you can find in the App Store for free.
