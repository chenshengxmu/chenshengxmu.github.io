* Apple recently announced on the iTunes Connect website that app developers can distribute promo codes to iTunes users outside of the U.S. Previously, promo codes only worked for iTunes users in the U.S.
* This news is a great thing for app users around the world. You now have the opportunity to receive codes for apps that developers wish to share for free…
* After two years of promo codes being restricted to the United States, Apple explained the new, worldwide use of promo codes in their official statement on iTunes Connect,
* “Your promo code distribution is no longer limited to U.S. customers. Promo codes in iTunes Connect can now be redeemed by all App Store customers worldwide. Your Team Agent can request 50 codes per version of your app in iTunes Connect and your customers can redeem these codes in any App Store. To learn more about requesting promo codes in iTunes Connect, see the iTunes Connect Developer Guide”
* I’m sure developers will jump all over this opportunity to gift apps to international users.

* If you didn’t know, you can enter promo codes straight into the App Store app on your iPhone. Simply scroll to the bottom of the “Featured” page in the App Store app. You will see a “Redeem” button right above your iTunes account’s email address. Press the button, copy and paste your code (or just type it) into the field and hit “Redeem” in the top right corner. Tada! Your free app should start downloading to your iPhone right away.
* ﻿I know that here at iDB, we’re excited for our international readers to be able to take part in more promo code giveaways in the future.
* If you’re in international iPhone user, are you looking forward to having access to iTunes promo codes?
