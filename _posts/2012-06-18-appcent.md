* AppCent is a new jailbreak tweak that adds a percentage value beneath the app currently being installed on your iOS device. It’s a very simple tweak, and for smaller sized apps you probably won’t derive much value, but it’s nice to have for larger apps that take a long time to download.
* Although a progress bar indicating your download percentage already exists in iOS, there’s something to be said for having actual numerical values that you can see and identify with…
* Once installed, there are no settings or options to configure outside of a kill switch located in the Settings app. All you need to do is start downloading apps from the App Store, and you’ll see a numerical percentage beneath the app icon to go along with the normal progress bar.
* AppCent can be downloaded for free on Cydia’s ModMyi repo. Let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
