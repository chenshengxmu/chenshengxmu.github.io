* First, I will explain what SSH is and why we do it. SSH (Secure Shell) allows you to exchange data between two networked devices, using a secure channel. A jailbroken iPhone has the ability to connect with your computer via SSH, giving you read and write access to your iDevice’s hard drive.
* You can repair damaged files, install games that aren’t in the App Store, and even turn your iDevice into a portable hard drive. I know it all sounds complicated, but we use applications to make the process as easy as browsing a folder on your computer. This is my quick and easy guide to SSH into your iPhone….
* For starters, your device must be jailbroken. You must also have an active Wi-Fi connection on both your iDevice and your computer.
* Step 1: Download Cyberduck. (Windows beta version here)
* Step 2: In your jailbroken iDevice, open ‘Cydia.app’ and do a search for ‘OpenSSH’. Go ahead and install it, and jump back on your computer.
* Step 3: Open the Cyberduck application we downloaded earlier and click the ‘Open Connection’ button.
* Step 4: In the server field you are going to type your iDevice’s IP address. This can be found by launching your ‘Settings.app’, selecting ‘Wi-Fi’, and selecting the blue arrow next to your wireless network. You should now see your IP address.

* Step 5: Select the ‘SFTP’ option in the drop down menu above where you just typed in your IP address.
* Step 6: In the Username field type in ‘root’. In the Password field type ‘alpine’. Click connect! You are now looking at the file system underneath Apple’s iOS!
* Note: The first SSH may take a bit, after that it should be fine. If you get an ‘Unknown Host’ message, just ignore it and click ‘Allow’.
* See that wasn’t so bad, was it? My last piece of advice would be BE CAREFUL. Deleting or manipulating the wrong files can turn your iPhone into a paperweight.
* Does anyone use a better SSH client? What ways are you using SSH? Tell us about it below!
