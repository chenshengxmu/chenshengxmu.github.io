* If you’ve got a jailbroken iOS 11 device, then you’re probably wondering what kinds of jailbreak tweaks you should be installing on it. Fortunately, we’ve got you covered.
* In this roundup, we’ll be talking about all the jailbreak tweaks released in Cydia from September 3rd to September 9th. As usual, we’ll kick things off by discussing our favorites and then outline the rest afterward.

* Apace 2 brings some much-needed functional enhancements to iOS’ Now Playing interface. Not only does it let you manage playlists and more directly from Now Playing-integrated toggles and shortcuts, but it supports popular music apps like Deezer and Spotify in addition to Apple Music.
* We particularly like how Apace 2 is built into the Now Playing interface, as this is undoubtedly the same approach Apple would have taken if they had any intention of undertaking such a project.
* You can learn more about Apace 2 and how it augments the Now Playing interface in our full review.

* AutoAnswer X (iOS 11) is a somewhat interesting tweak in that it lets you automatically answer incoming phone, FaceTime, and third-party VoIP calls that match specific criteria.
* Not only could you use this tweak improve the phone call experience while driving, but you can also use it in more creative ways. For example, you could transform an unused older handset into a video-based baby monitor that accepts video FaceTime calls from your specific contact card.
* The tweak comes with a huge list of customization options, all of which you can learn more about in our full review.
