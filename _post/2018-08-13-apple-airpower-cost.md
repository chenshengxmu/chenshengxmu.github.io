* Apple’s long-delayed AirPower wireless charging pad for iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, could be priced at around $149 when it arrives this fall. This news comes from Chinese website Chongdiantou (via LoveiOS), which claims the price came from “industry insiders.”
* The oval-shaped AirPower accessory was announced during last year’s iPhone X event and can inductively charge multiple Apple devices at once. There have been numerous delays for the AirPower since it was announced. The accessory was once thought to be arriving in March and then June.
* Two months ago, Bloomberg reported the device would finally launch “before or in September.” Assuming this is correct, the accessory will almost certainly launch when Apple’s 2018 iOS device lineup arrives in stores. This year, Cupertino is expected to reveal three new iPhones, two new iPad Pros, and a fourth-generation Apple Watch.
* In discussing the reason for the AirPower delay, Bloomberg noted in June:
* An executive at an Apple partner that manufactures third-party wireless chargers for iPhones, who asked not to be identified, said that the multi-device charging mechanism is challenging to build because it likely requires different sized charging components for the three types of devices, which would all overlap across the mat.
* We’ll continue to follow this story.
* In the meantime, which 2018 Apple product do you plan on buying? Let us know below.
