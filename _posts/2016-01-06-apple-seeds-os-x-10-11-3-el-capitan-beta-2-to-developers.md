* Three weeks after releasing the first beta of OS X 10.11 El Capitan’s third major software update, and 48 hours after seeding iOS 9.2.1 beta 2 to developers and public beta testers, Apple on Wednesday released a second beta of OS X 10.11.3 El Capitan.
* It can be installed on machines running a prior beta through the Mac App Store’s Updates tab and downloaded through Apple’s portal for members of the Apple Developer Program.
* The pre-release software is also available to public beta testers who signed up for Apple’s Beta Software Program.
* Today’s beta has a build number of 15D9c. The official changelog makes no mention of any new features or user-facing enhancements as Apple continues to focus on under-the-hood improvements.
* The third major software update to OS X El Capitan should improve the stability, security and performance of your Mac while possibly adding some new features.
* We’ll update this post with any changes as we encounter them.
