* Ask and you shall receive.
* This is what I thought when I found out that iOS 7 will have a new feature which will let you perform audio calls via FaceTime. It was only two weeks ago that I publicly asked for this new feature and it’s is now a reality. Did Apple hear me? Probably not, but it’s good to know this is coming to an iOS device near you soon.
* Dubbed as FaceTime audio, it’s not hard to imagine this feature being a direct competitor to Skype…
* I’m actually surprised they haven’t come up with this feature before. Clearly, if Apple was able to connect two people with video+audio, audio only should have been a no brainer.
* Now I’ll finally be able to FaceTime my Mom without having her see me and tell me it’s time I cut my hair.
