* Wow, just wow. Angry Birds maker Rovio just announced in a tweet that Angry Birds Space, the latest installment in the popular series, has hit the hundred million downloads mark across all platforms.
* If that didn’t give you a pause, remember that just a little over a month ago the game topped 50 million downloads in the first 35 days since its launch (ten million downloads in the first three days)…
* As of May 9, all Angry Birds games across all platforms hit an astounding one billion downloads.
* That’s a major uptake from approximately 648 million downloads as of end of 2011, commanding an astounding 200 million active monthly users.
* Rovio also announced  earlier this month that their Facebook page now has 20 million fans.
* Speaking of which, don’t forget to like iDB’s Facebook page as well!
* Rovio is also slated to release their web-only game called Angry Birds Heikki on June 18.
* As for Angry Birds Space, the game was recently updated with a bunch of new levels that let you squawk your way through a cosmos of donuts, cakes and very hungry piggies.
* But Rovio is not resting on its laurels.
* Their vice president of franchise development Ville Heijari confirmed that Rovio recently acquired all rights to Casey’s Contraptions, a charming and highly addictive puzzle game by Snappy Touch and Mystery Coconut.
* Consequentially, Rovio will tap the newly purchased IP to re-brand and re-work Casey’s Contraption as Amazing Alex, a brand new Rovio game set for release later this summer.
* Are you still playing Angry Birds?
