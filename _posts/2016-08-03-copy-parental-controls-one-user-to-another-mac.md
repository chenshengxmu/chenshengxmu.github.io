* If you have one Mac, and multiple users, then you might use the built-in Parental Controls to manage what those users can and cannot do. Doing so can help the security of your system in many ways.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to you can essentially copy the Parental Control settings from one of your Mac’s users over to another user so they’re managed in the same way.
* If you’re a parent, and you let your kids log into your Mac, then it’s a good idea to limit their access to certain things with Parental Controls to ensure your (and their) safety. After all, things can get pretty ugly if they don’t have enough limitations and they just do whatever they want.
* In situations where you have more than one kid, you may want to save yourself some time and rather than configuring each user account manually, you can easily copy the settings from one of your kids’ user accounts in OS X to another so they’re managed in exactly the same way.
* What does this do for you in the end? It saves you a lot of time and headache and ensures that they’re fairly managed in the same manner. This way, you don’t have one of them coming up to you and asking, “why does he/she get to do something, and not me?!”
* The process works the same for network administrators who are trying to oversee a large variety of machines in a school or institution and need to keep guest users from over-stepping their boundaries as temporary computer users. Since administrators usually deal with a high volume of machines and user accounts, this is an invaluable time-saving feature.
* So if you’ve decided you want to impose the same Parental Control settings on more than one of the standard user accounts on your Mac, then you’ve stumbled upon the right tutorial.
* To do it, you will follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the System Preferences app on your Mac and open the Parental Controls preferences pane.
