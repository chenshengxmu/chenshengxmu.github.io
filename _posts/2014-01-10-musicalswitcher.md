* Every so often, a jailbreak tweak is released on Cydia that does something completely different. These tweaks usually have no real benefit other than the fact that they do something weird or obscure.
* MusicalSwitcher is one of those tweaks that fits the aforementioned description to a tee. It has no real benefit, but it allows you to use your app switcher pages as if they were keys on a piano. You’re just going to have to watch this video to see what I mean.
* The iOS 7 app switcher brings full screen page previews to the mix, and these pages can be eliminated with a simple swipe up gesture. Swiping down on the pages normally doesn’t do anything, except for iOS’ patented rubber-banding animation.
* With MusicalSwitcher installed, swiping down on a page plays an audible note that sounds like a piano. Each page is assigned to its own note, resulting in a slightly different sound. Of course, the app switcher in iOS 7 is a bit too cumbersome to break it down like Ray Charles, but it’s still a fairly cool tweak to show off to your buddies.
* MusicalSwitcher is available for free on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. If you decide to try it, do like we always suggest and leave us a comment down below.
