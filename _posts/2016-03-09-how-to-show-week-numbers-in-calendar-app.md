title: How to show week numbers in Calendar app
---
* Apple’s Calendar app for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac does a fine job in helping organize your schedule and making your more productive.
* Like many other people, I like to browse my calendars with week numbers enabled as this helps me better understand my events and tasks for the month.
* The Calendar app does not show week numbers by default, but don’t you worry—this tutorial will teach you how to enable display of week numbers in your calendar views across iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices.
* 1) On your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings → Calendars.
* 2) Flip the switch labeled Week Numbers to the ON position.

* This will enable display of week numbers in the monthly calendar. Week numbers are not available in Day and Year views on Calendar for iOS.

* Despite the fact that week numbers are unavailable in the Calendar web app at iCloud.com/calendar, I like having that setting enabled on iOS and macOS.
* At any rate, it’s far better to visually determine what week number of the year any date falls on than having to count the weeks manually like an animal.
