* During a highly anticipated media event last month, Apple unveiled the iPhone 4S. Although the handset looks similar to its predecessor, it includes a number of internal changes. Among those changes is the addition of the A5 dual core processor.
* To show off the iPhone 4S’ performance capibilities, Apple demoed the upcoming Infinity Blade 2 title from Epic games. The original Infinity Blade was a hit, and set the bar for in-game graphics. Well its successor doesn’t just raise the bar, it smashes it…
* Infinity Blade 2 is expected to be a big hit when it drops next week. And if you are still on the fence about whether or not you are going to be purchasing the game, you might want to check out this new developer trailer:
* The game will be compatible with the same hardware as the previous version, but will obviously look and perform much better on A5 devices. Between its stunning graphics and iOS 5’s new Airplay mirroring feature, Infinity Blade 2 will help lend credibility to iOS as a serious gaming platform.
* Look for Infinity Blade 2 in the App Store on December 1st.
