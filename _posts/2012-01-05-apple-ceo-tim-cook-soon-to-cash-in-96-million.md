title: Apple CEO Tim Cook to Cash In $96 Million
---
* Tim Cook is starting 2012 off right with an upcoming pay day of over $96,000,000:
* Of all the Silicon Valley executives who have a vesting event scheduled for the first quarter of 2012, the one who stands to reap the most is Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook, the study found.
* Mr. Cook has portions of two restricted-stock-unit grants—including one he received for filling in for Steve Jobs when the co-founder was on medical leave—vesting in the first quarter. As of Apple’s closing stock price on Dec 30, those vesting shares of Mr. Cook’s were worth $96.2 million, according to the study.
* This plus the one million Apple shares Tim Cook received back in August makes him quite a wealthy fellow.
