* Readdle, Ukrainian developer of premium iOS and macOS apps, today announced a bunch of new productivity features for its award-winning Spark email app for Mac as well as a pair of noteworthy updates to Spark for iPhone and iPad.
* In addition to gaining support for Apple’s Reminders app and ten popular third-party services, including Things, OmniFocus and Wunderlist, Spark for Mac app now makes it easy to use your emails in other apps thanks to a one-click email export feature with a variety of export options tailored to each specific third-party service.
* Spark for Mac now supports the following third-party integrations:
* “Our goal was to make it easy for you to organize information and create tasks seamlessly in the services that you use,” the company said.
* With these newly introduced integrations and the one-click export capability with a variety of options at your disposal, you are now able to open Spark emails from your favorite third-party app via unique links and have the ability to customize input fields for each task.
* To export an email message, open it in Spark, select the service you need, then click Save.
* Spark power users get to enjoy custom keyboard shortcuts for each service that let them export an email without taking their hands-off the keyboard.
* For each service, Spark presents you with different export options.
* It’s pretty nice that the export window is fully customized to match the style of each service you’re using. Specific per-service export options allow you to, as an example, extract a back link to the email saved in your to-do app or save a PDF of the email to Asana.
* “For every message you export, either a long email with attachments or a short message from your colleague, we always add the link that will bring you back to the original conversation,” explains Readdle. “With a back link, you no longer have to copy and paste chunks of a message, all of it is one click away, available in Spark.”

* On the iOS side, the iPhone and iPad app has gained the ability to protect your inbox with Touch ID and a custom four-digit passcode. Another new feature, integration with Readdle’s PDF Expert app, lets you edit and send PDFs straight from Spark.
* By the way, Readdle turned ten two weeks ago.
