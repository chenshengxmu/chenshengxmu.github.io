* Filippo Bigarella recently pushed out an update to CleverPin — the jailbreak tweak that automatically unlocks an iOS device when it detects that it’s connected to a friendly WiFi network.
* To celebrate, he’s decided to give away a copy of the tweak to 5 of our readers. What can you can expect from CleverPin? How do you win your own free copy? Check inside for the details…
* CleverPin has been updated to significantly improve its efficiency and reliability. We reviewed the tweak initially back in April of last year, but since it’s been so long, and since that video appeared on our old YouTube channel, we figured it would’t hurt to shoot another.
* To enter simply post the following in the comment section below:
* 1: The passcode I used to unlock my iPhone in the video 2: Your Cydia account number
* We will pick 5 winners at random. You will be contacted via the contact credentials on your comment, so be sure to post with valid credentials.
* Your Cydia ID’s will be added for your free copy of CleverPin shortly. Thanks for entering, and congratulations to the winners.
