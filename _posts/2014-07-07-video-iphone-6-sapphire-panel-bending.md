* Our favorite parts leaker, Australia-born Sonny Dickson, is back at it again with a new video that seems to offer a look at an alleged sapphire-strengthened cover glass, presumably for Apple’s next iPhone.
* As you know, all iPhones models incorporate Gorilla Glass designed and produced by U.S.-based company Corning.
* That being said, pundits have been calling for a sapphire iPhone ever since Apple earlier in the year confirmed prepaying over half a billion dollars to GT Advanced to secure multi-year supply of sapphire glass on an exclusive basis.
* For those unfamiliar with sapphire, Wikipedia is your friend. In a nutshell, the precious gemstone’s hardness is second only to diamond, making it a no-brainer for the 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 6…
* Check it out below.
* Not much to report here in terms of the specifics. The sapphire panel appears to be subjected to a limited bending stress test so we can’t really estimate its hardness compared to Gorilla Glass.
* Dickson’s short clip is part of a longer video published by French blog Nowhereelse.fr [Google Translate]. It offers a nice side-by-side comparison against the iPhone 5s, have a look at it below.
* Apple has recognized sapphire’s scratch resistance: rear camera lenses on iOS devices and the iPhone 5s’s Touch ID home button are both protected by sapphire. However, churning out sapphire-made cover glass for iPhones on an industrial scale comes with its own set of problems because sapphire productions is ten times more expensive than Gorilla Glass.
* Also, the process is time consuming and requires disproportionally large amounts of energy. Pictured below: a 115kg cylindrical section of industrial sapphire called a “boule.”

* Dickson is a well-known parts leaker who has previously proved himself accurate with photos of genuine iPhone parts. That being said, take the video with a grain of salt: that thin sheet of sapphire could be an early prototype that has been abandoned or the real part belonging to a different device.
* A sapphire-made smartphone display cover is 2.5 times stronger than Gorilla Glass and tougher than almost any material except for diamonds, leading some to call it a practically un-scratchable display coating.
* Here’s a quick video tour of Apple’s Mesa plant by PocketNow. The facility is being exclusively operated on behalf of Apple by GT Advanced Technologies.
* We know a great deal about the sophisticated factory, which can produce an estimated 200 million units of sapphire sheets measuring five inches diagonally. On the other hand, AppleInsider offers a number of solid arguments as to why all sapphire iPhone rumors recall Liquidmetal hype.
* What do you think?
* Will/should the iPhone 6 feature a sapphire-strengthened screen?
