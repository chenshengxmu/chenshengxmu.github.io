* Not even two weeks after releasing iOS 5 Beta 6 to developers, Apple just released iOS 5 Beta 7. If you’re already on Beta 6, simply go to Settings > General > Software Update in order to update your iDevice. That is, unless you are jailbroken, in which case, you will not be able to update over-the-air. But you can always update via iTunes.
* Seven beta versions for an iOS firmware is unheard of so far. Apple sure is polishing this new software, which should be released to the public in the next few weeks.
* We have the full change log below…
* You can workaround this by implementing the relinquishPresentedItemToWriter: method and checking to see if the writer actually wrote when your file presenter reacquires.
* File presenters do receive presentedItemDidChange: messages in this beta.
* These logs can grow large very quickly, so you should remove the profile after you have reproduced the problem and pulled the logs for the bug report.
* Of course, this is for developers only, or for those of you who like to know what Apple is up to.
* Make sure to let us know if you find anything interesting in iOS 5 Beta 7.
