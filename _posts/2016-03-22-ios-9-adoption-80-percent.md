* In less than two weeks since iOS 9 was powering a reported 79 percent of devices, that figure has now climbed by one percentage point to eighty percent of devices, a significant milestone. While the new iOS 9 adoption numbers are yet to be publicized on Apple’s App Store dashboard for developers, the freshest figure was mentioned on stage at yesterday’s ‘Let us loop you in’ media event by Greg Joswiak, Apple’s Vice President of iPhone Marketing.
* “iOS 9 today is running on eight percent of our active iOS devices,” said Joswiak.
* “That compares incredibly favorably to the latest version of Android, which is running on two percent of their active devices,” he continued.

* As per Google’s own Android dashboard webpage, Android Marshmallow, which also released last fall like iOS 9, is currently installed on 2.3 percent of Android smartphones and tablets Android Lollipop versions accounted for 36.1 percent of Android devices and Android KitKat accounted for 34.3 percent of Android devices that ship with the Play Store app pre-installed.

* Google’s numbers were derived from Play Store access logs during a seven-day period ending on March 7, 2016. The Play Store app supports Android 2.2 and above so devices running older versions are not included in Android adoption figures.
* Android hardware powered by forked versions of Android, like Amazon Fire devices, and Android devices that run third-party app stores, like smartphones and tablets sold in China, are not counted either.
