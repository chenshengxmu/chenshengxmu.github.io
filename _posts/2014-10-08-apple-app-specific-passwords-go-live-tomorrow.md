* If you have two-step verification enabled and you’re currently signed in to a third-party app using your Apple ID password, you’ll need to adjust to a new change starting tomorrow. For security purposes, Apple is introducing app-specific passwords to access iCloud data using third-party apps.
* Apple will allow users to generate these app-specific passwords via the Password & Security section of its Apple ID website. Once there, you’ll simply need to click Generate App-Specific Password to create a password for the third-party app that you wish to grant access to your iCloud data.
* A few minutes ago, I received this email highlighting the changes and subsequent requirements:

* This means that if you’re now signed into a third-party app with your Apple ID credentials, you’ll be signed out automatically, and you’ll need to generate a new password using the outlined steps. Apps that may be affected included Outlook, and other third-party email apps. You might also find that you need to generate an app-specific password for calendar apps that use your Apple ID to access your iCloud calendars. One such calendar that comes to mind is Fantastical for the Mac.
* To create an app specific password, go to the Apple ID website → Password & Security → Generate an app-specific password.

* You can view app-specific password history and revoke single passwords or all passwords
* Users will be able to have up to 25 app-sepecific passwords configured at any one time. You’ll be able to view your password history, and revoke all or individual passwords to free up space if needed.
* Overall, this is great news for user security. We still get to grant our favorite third-party apps access to our iCloud data, but we will now be able to do so in such a way that keeps our primary Apple ID password safe and secure.
* Are you happy that Apple is taking more drastic measures to ensure user security as of late?
