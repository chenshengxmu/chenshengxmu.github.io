* Sparrow for iPhone, in spite of its shortcomings, has become my default email client on the iPhone.
* I can’t recall the last time I launched Apple’s Mail app as Sparrow for iPhone beats Apple’s stock app offering in terms of user friendliness, sleekness, elegance, ease of use and Gmail accounts handling, among other things.
* But Sparrow’s lack of native iPad interface has been ticking me off as the vast majority of my email management happens on my iPad.
* Well, the wait will soon be over as the Sparrow developer just teased a new page confirming that Sparrow for iPad is coming…
* According to a new teaser page at, the team is working on “something bigger”.
* Of course, jailbreak community is also at work to bring native-like iPad support to Sparrow via a handy tweak dubbed SparrowPlus.
* I only have two major gripes with Sparrow.
* First, due to restrictions on Apple’s end, notifications for incoming email messages are not possible unless the app is running in the background, and only for a short period of time.

* The Sparrow team confirmed they’re working with Apple on resolving this issue, hinting that they might charge for this feature in a future update because basically they’re going to have to run notifications through their own servers.
* The other issue is an annoyance rather than a biggie: when you compose an email message in a third-party app that brings up the standard email compose sheet, that message gets sent through the stock Mail app.
* Why?
* Because the way iOS defaults are set up, third-party email clients are prohibited from registering themselves as default handlers for email messages.
* In other words, unless Apple does a virtual 180-degree turn on its current stance, this will never be a feature of Sparrow, or any other third-party email client for that matter.
* Talk to Apple.
