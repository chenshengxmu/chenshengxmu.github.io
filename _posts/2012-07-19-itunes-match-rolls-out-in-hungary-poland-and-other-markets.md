* iTunes Match, Apple’s scan-and-match music service (also doubling as a streaming service of sorts), is being rolled out in Hungary, Poland and several other markets, it’s been revealed today. This is in addition to an expansion in late April that saw iTunes Match roll out in Greece, Portugal, Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria and other markets…
* 9to5Mac first received tips about the iTunes Match roll-out, as reported by Jordan Kahn:
* We are receiving several tips that Apple has started rolling out the iTunes Match service in Poland, Hungary, and possibly a few other unconfirmed markets.
* According to Plastik.hu, iTunes Match costs 24.99 euros in Hungary, reflecting the price point in other European markets like Italy.
* Apple’s support document lists 55 iTunes Match-enabled countries, but was not updated to include the new markets at press time.
* iTunes Match scans users’ music library to find matching songs in the iTunes Store. Users can then upgrade their local files to their 256Kbps AAC versions from the iTunes Store and download or stream those songs to computers and iOS devices authorized with the same iTunes account.
* It also gives you piece of mind knowing that all your iTunes purchases and matched songs are kept in a secure iCloud locker as long as you continue paying an annual fee of $25 bucks.
* If you spotted iTunes Match going live in your country, let us know down in the comments.
