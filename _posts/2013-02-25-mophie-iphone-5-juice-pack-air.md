* Fans of Mophie’s popular Juice Pack Air line will be happy to hear that the company has just announced a new, thinner model for Apple’s latest handset. This is the first significant update to the line in two years.
* Aside from the prestige of its highly-regarded creators, the major selling point for the new Air is its size—it’s both thinner and lighter than its predecessor, measuring in at just 0.63-inches thick…
* This isn’t Mophie’s first run at an iPhone 5 case. Earlier this year it introduced the Helium Juice Pack, which is fairly similar to the Air in size, though the Air is a hair bulkier at 2.60in x 5.54in x 0.63in and 2.68 oz.
* But that extra bulk is put to good use, as the Air comes with a bigger battery than the Helium—1500mAh vs. 1700mAh—meaning longer up-time. Mophie says its new case should double your handset’s battery life.
* Interested? The new Mophie Juice Pack Air for the iPhone 5 is available for purchase on Mophie’s website for $99. It comes in 3 colors, red, white and black, and starts shipping within the next week or so.
* Do you plan on grabbing a new Juice Pack Air?
