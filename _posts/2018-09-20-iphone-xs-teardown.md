* As an “S” device, most didn’t expect the iPhone XS to be all that different than its predecessor, the iPhone X, at least on the inside. What’s being billed as the first iPhone XS teardown mostly confirms this expectation.
* Dutch site FixjeiPhone has posted images it claims to show the inside of the 5.8-inch iPhone XS. The teardown shows one crucial change. While last year’s iPhone X included two batteries next to each other in the shape of an L, there’s only one of this year’s model. Not surprisingly, this battery is L-shaped.

* Last year, respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple’s 2018 iPhone would feature an L-shaped battery design. It looks like he was correct.
* Earlier this week, Chinese regulatory documents showed the iPhone XS includes a smaller battery than its predecessor, the iPhone X, 2,658mAh versus 2,716mAH. Despite this, Apple claims the iPhone XS can last up to 30 minutes more between charges than the older model. The 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max is likely to ship with a battery with a capability of 3,174mAH. Apple says the new phone should last 90 minutes more between charges versus the iPhone X.
* The 6.1-inch iPhone XR, which doesn’t arrive until late October, should include a 2,942mAh battery. Apple promises 90 more minutes of usage between charges versus the iPhone 8.
* The FixjeiPhone iPhone XS teardown also shows the iPhone XS logic board, which we’ve included here.
