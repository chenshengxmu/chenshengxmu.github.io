* As first reported by Chargerlab, Apple has updated the logos for its Made-for-iPhone/iPad/iPod (MFi) program. The biggest difference is that the device icons have been removed, replaced instead with an Apple logo.
* Other changes include the order of the products on the all-encompassing logo. Previously it was “iPod iPhone iPad” and it now reads “iPhone iPad iPod”. This is clearly because of the importance of the iPhone in the lineup, and the decreasing status of the iPod.
* The MFi program is used by Apple to certify accessories that meet its quality standards. Apple provides logos to the accessory makers to put on the packaging. The logos are meant to signify to consumers that the product is an official, Apple-approved accessory for i-devices. You will see it on docks, cases, and Lightning cables.
* Being able to use the MFi logo is one of the main benefits for accessory makers to join the licensing program.
* The new logos, introduced at the beginning of February, are mandatory for manufacturers to adopt within the next 90 days.
