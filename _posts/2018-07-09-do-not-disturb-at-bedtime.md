* In iOS 12, Apple has introduced a new tool called Do Not Disturb at Bedtime. As its name suggests, the new feature silences notifications at night. Additionally, when you have the feature enabled, you won’t see anything on your phone’s Lock Screen except for the time and date. Here’s a quick overview on how Do Not Disturb at Bedtime works. 
* You can activate the new feature by following these steps:
* 1) In the Settings app, select Do Not Disturb.
* 2) If you haven’t already done so, select a schedule. It should include a “from” and “to” time. Ideally, think of this range as when you’re in bed and want to be sleeping.

* 3) Toggle Bedtime Mode to the ON position.
* In the example above, the Do Not Disturb at Bedtime mode is activated each night between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.
* During Bedtime Mode, you will no longer see notifications or media tiles on your Lock Screen. Instead, the screen will dim, and you will only see the time, date, and status bar.
* Like the Do Not Disturb feature found on previous iOS versions, with the Bedtime Mode activated you can still use your device. The only thing that changes is you won’t see those pesky notifications until the morning.
* You can disable the new feature by :
* 1) Open the Settings app.
* 2) Select Do Not Disturb.
* 3) Toggle Bedtime Mode to the OFF position.
* The Do Not Disturb at Bedtime feature is simple to set up and use and could prove very useful, especially if you’re the type of person who wakes up easily in the middle of the night. The new tool should make your night more restful.
* Apple’s expected to release iOS 12 alongside new versions of watchOS, tvOS, and macOS this fall. The latest iOS version includes performance, security, and battery-saving updates. It also introduces all-new apps such as Measure and Shortcuts.
