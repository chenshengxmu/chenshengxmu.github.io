* If you have already downloaded Apple’s latest update to its mobile operating system, you’ll be happy to know that Readdle has been working hard to add extensions, widgets, iCloud Drive compatibility, and much more to its apps.
* Scanner Pro, PDF Expert 5, Documents 5, Calendars 5, Printer Pro, and PDF Converter have all been updated with new features that compliment the productivity additions in iOS 8. Check out what each app can do for you now.
* Scanner Pro is now compatible with iOS 8’s extensions. You can scan photos in your device’s camera roll directly from your Photos app. Take a picture of a receipt, open the Photos app, and tap “Edit” to access the extensions menu. Then, open the extensions menu and select Scanner Pro extension. The feature will automatically crop and edit the image to prepare it for scanning. You can also select a color or grayscale filter and adjust the contrast and brightness. Press “Done” and the scan will automatically save in your camera roll. This app is available for $6. 99. The update is free.
* PDF Expert 5 now includes Zoom Writing, AirTurn support, and bookmark management. It supports iCloud Drive for document storage. You can now open documents from any iCloud Drive folder using iOS 8’s Document Picker. You can access files in iCloud Drive and other third-party storage apps using the Provider Extension. Secure files using Touch ID authentication for apps that you’ve set specific passcodes for. This app is available for $9.99. The update is free.

* Documents 5 is also compatible with iCloud Drive, so you can open and view any file from the cloud storage service. You can now open, edit, and annotate a document from iCloud Drive using PDF Expert 5 on your iPhone or iPad, switching seamlessly without losing your edits. You can also move files between folders and use other apps to open files in both Documents and PDF Expert. This app and its update are available for free.
* Readdle’s smart calendar app is now a widget that can be viewed in Today’s View and Notification Center. See upcoming tasks and events quickly and easily and create new events right from Today’s Menu. The Notification Center widget lets you see and “snooze” alerts for events taking place today. Simply open Notification Center, scroll to the bottom and tap “Edit,” and then toggle Calendars 5 on. This app is available for $6.99. The update is free.
* With Printer Pro, you can now wirelessly print any document from iCloud Drive. Additionally, the iPad app has also been updated to be universal. The iPhone version will no longer be supported “as soon as all users get the update.” So, be sure to get your bonus iPad compatibility update before you lose it. This app is available for $6.99. The update is free.
* For those who regularly need to turn documents into PDF files, this app is now available as an extension. You can turn any file, photo, or even web page into a PDF directly from your device’s camera roll in the Photos app. All you have to do is select the picture from the Photos app, tap “Edit,” and open the extensions menu. Select PDF Converter and it will turn whatever you have selected into a PDF. It is also compatible with iCloud Drive. So, you can turn any file from the cloud storage service into a PDF, as well. This app is available for $6.99. The update is free.
