* With more than 50 million users, Dropbox is in a league of its own when it comes to third party cloud services. Its drag-and-drop storage platform allows users to keep their content synced across all of their devices.
* Well the service just got a little bit better for iOS users. Dropbox 1.5 popped up in the App Store last night, bringing with it new features like automatic photo and video uploads, and an all-new content gallery view…
* The new media upload feature is actually a pretty big deal. Once enabled, it will automatically upload any recently taken photos and videos upon each launch of the Dropbox application. In fact, the company wants you to use it so bad that they’re giving out 500MB of free storage space just for turning it on.
* There are a few other enhancements in the update as well, such as the new gallery view. This allows users to see an overview of all of their content that they have stored with the service, making it much easier to find things.
* All in all, this is a solid update. For those interested, Dropbox 1.5 is available, for both the iPhone and the iPad, in the App Store for free.
