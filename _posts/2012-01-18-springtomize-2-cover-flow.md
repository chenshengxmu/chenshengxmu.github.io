* While we’re on the subject of Cover Flow dock tweaks, let us not forget that Springtomize 2 has featured a similar tweak since its inception. True, it’s not exactly like Adam Bell’s Overflow tweak, but if you already own Springtomize 2 you might as well give it a shot.
* Springtomize 2 comes in at $2.99 on the Cydia store, but chances are you already have it seeing as it customizes your device like no other tweak in existence. We’ve taken the liberty to highlight Springtomize’s Cover Flow implementation on video, so be sure to have a look.
* Again, this is used in tandem with Infinidock to achieve the Cover Flow effect. How do you think this stacks up against Overflow?
