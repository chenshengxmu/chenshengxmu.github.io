* If you’re jailbroken with Electra and looking for quirky new ways to customize your newly-pwned device’s behavior, then you might take an interest in a new jailbreak tweak called Jitter by iOS developer SecondEight1.
* Jitter uses an idiosyncratic approach to grab your attention whenever your app(s) sport unread notifications. More specifically, it animates the app icons that have unread notifications with one of seven customizable animations.
* The developer shared one of the animation styles, known as Classic Jitter, from his Twitter account below:

* Jitter adds a preference pane to the Settings app where you can configure the tweak to your liking:

* Here, you can:
* At the very bottom of the preference pane, you can utilize a Respring button to save your settings each time you adjust them.
* At first glance, animating the app icons with unread notifications might seem like a superfluous feature, but on the contrary, it enhances the attention-grabbing aesthetic of those apps, so you never miss a beat. Furthermore, it’s sure to turn a few heads and get people talking about jailbreaking.
* If you’re interested in trying Jitter, then you can download it from Cydia’s Packix repository for $1.50. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 11 devices.
