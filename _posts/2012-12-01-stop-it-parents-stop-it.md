* Did you know that in 2012, it’s become completely acceptable to name your newborn after an Apple product? In fact, it’s not only acceptable, it’s become quite trendy.
* BabyCenter just published their list of this year’s most popular baby names. And while choices like Siri and Apple didn’t make the top 100, they did shoot up the charts…
* The name Apple, though a rather unusual choice, rose 15% for girls this year, vaulting it 585 spots up the popular baby names list. That’s a pretty big jump for 12 months.
* The name Mac, which to me is a much more common choice, also saw a decent increase with a 12% climb. And Siri, Apple’s lovable digital assistant, scaled up 5%.
* Now, I love my Apple gadgets as much as the next person. But I can’t imagine naming my daughter Apple. C’mon parents, these kids have to live with these monikers forever.
* You know what the most popular baby name of 2012 was? Sophia.
