* Accidents always happen to others. That’s what we tend to believe anyway. Besides being largely misguided, thinking you’re less likely to get into an accident than the person sitting next to you can be dangerous, mainly because it can lead to you being unprepared in the event you would get into an accident.
* There aren’t many ways you can be ready in case something happens to you, but there is one thing you can do right now, directly from your iPhone, and it shouldn’t take you more than a couple minutes.
* Along with iOS 8 came a new application called Health which aggregates health and fitness-related information from third-party apps. But the Health app also has a feature that lets you create a Medical ID accessible to anyone from the Lock screen of your device.
* Say you’re riding your bike and get hit by a bus. By the time the ambulance comes to you, you’ve already lost a considerable amount of blood. A blood transfusion could save your life, but the medics first need to know what your blood type is. Thanks to Medical ID, they can quickly find out, assuming you filled it out, just by having access to your iPhone Lock screen. This could save your life.
* Medical ID isn’t only helpful to show what your blood type is. It can also be used to display known medical conditions and allergies, which again is information that can be vital.
* Step 1: Launch the Health app that comes pre-installed with iOS 8.
* Step 2: Tap on the Medical ID tab at the bottom right of the screen.
* Step 3: If this is your first time there, the app will invite you to create a Medical ID. Simply tap on Create Medical ID.
* Step 4: From there, start filling out all your information. Make sure that  “Show When Locked” is turned on, which will allow medics to actually have access to your Medical ID card. It’s also wise to add an emergency contact.
* Step 5: Tap Done when you’re done editing.
* From now on, when your phone is locked, anyone will be able to access your Medical ID from the Lock screen, simply by swiping to reveal the keypad, then selecting Emergency, then tapping on Medical ID at the bottom left.
* As iOS 8 installation base increases, this new feature will certainly be known by all medical professionals, and will definitely be used to save lives. You have no control over what happens to you, but you have complete control over the basic medical information you can share with first rescuers. Do yourself a favor, and fill out your Medical ID now, and make sure you tell everyone around you with an iOS 8 device to do the same. Your life and their life may depend on it.
