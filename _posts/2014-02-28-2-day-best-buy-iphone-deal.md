* Folks looking to score an iPhone 5s on the cheap may want to check out your local Best Buy store. I know it feels like we’re saying this on a weekly basis now, but the retailer is once again holding a sale on Apple’s most popular handset.
* This time around, Best Buy is offering a minimum of a $150 gift card for folks looking to trade-in an iPhone 4s or 5 for a new iPhone 5s. And between that and its current $50 off promotion, you could easily score a 16GB model for just $1…
* Here’s the advert, which you can see here:

* Of course, as with most deals, there’s a ton of fine print. For starters, you must use the gift card towards the purchase of an iPhone 5s with a 2-year agreement. And your trade-in device must be working, with no water damage or cracked glass.
* Obviously, trade-in value will depend on your phone’s condition, but the fact that Best Buy says you’ll get a minimum of $150 for it as long as it’s working makes this a solid deal. For reference, Gazelle only offers $120 for a ‘good’ 16GB iPhone 4S.
* If any of this interests you, make sure you act fast. Best Buy says this offer is only good through March 1st, so you have 2 days.
