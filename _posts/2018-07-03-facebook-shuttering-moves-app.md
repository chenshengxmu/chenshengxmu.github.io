* Facebook announced yesterday that it is planning to phase out the Moves fitness-tracking app that it purchased back in April 2014, as well as a pair of other apps—Hello and tbh.
* Facebook said it was shuttering the apps due to low usage.
* The company bought an anonymous social app for US high school students, called tbh, in 2017. In 2015, it launched Hello for its Android customers in the US, Brazil and Nigeria, which let folks combine data from Facebook with contact information on their phone.
* The company is scheduled to deprecate Hello in a few weeks and delete the user data from all three of these apps within 90 days, according to the press release.
* The Moves team announced that customers won’t be able to log in to the app after July 30, 2018. Users can save their personal activity history through July 30, 2018 using the step-by-step instructions included further below.
* If you have an existing Moves account with email or Facebook login:
* 1) Log in at accounts.moves-app.com/export.
* 2) Select Export Data.
* If you use the Moves app without a login credential:
* 1) Tap the Moves icon at the bottom right of the app’s home screen.
* 2) Select Settings, then Account.
* 3) Create an account by selecting Create Account.
* 4) Once creation is complete, check your email to confirm your email address.
* 5) Log in at accounts.moves-app.com/export.
* 6) Select Export Data.
* “This data is private and only accessible to you and the connected apps you authorized access for,” wrote the Moves team. “You can manage your connected apps and revoke access within your account settings at any time.”
* Moves was a really good app and I’m saddened to see it go down the drain.

* The social networking behemoth more than four years ago acquired Finnish startup ProtoGeo Oy, the brains behind the Moves app, and their developer talent in a bid to join the fitness-tracking market. Developers said Moves would continue to operate as a standalone app.
* “There are no plans to change that or commingle data with Facebook,” they said at the time.
* Moves is no longer available on App Store.
