* After confirming via the recently updated WWDC for iOS app that it will be kicking off its summer developer pilgrimage with a keynote on June 2, Apple has just confirmed that the two-hour event will be available as a free live stream on iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices, as well as on Mac and Windows PCs.
* According to a newly published webpage on the Apple Events microsite, fans are in for some “exciting announcements”…
* The keynote kicks off at 10:00am Pacific Time / 1pm Eastern Time.
* “Watch streaming video from this special event and learn more about our exciting announcements,” notes Apple.
* Additionally, both the State of the Union keynote address and Apple Design Awards will be live-streamed through Apple’s website in real-time.
* We’re of course expecting Apple CEO Tim Cook to headline the keynote.
* If past keynotes are an indication, he should be joined on stage by other senior executives, including SVP of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue (responsible for iCloud, iTunes and more); SVP of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi (responsible for iOS and OS X); and SVP of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller.
* And if The Financial Times newspaper is right, Apple should take the wraps off its rumored software platform for the connected home – Apple’s Internet of Things, if you will.

* If you plan on tuning in remotely and stream the show as it happens, you’ll need at least Safari 4 or later on Mac OS X 10.6 or later, Safari on iOS 4.2 or later or QuickTime 7 on Windows.
* A live-stream of the event will be also available on the second and third-generation Apple TV with Apple TV software 5.0.2 or later.
* As depicted on the screenshot above, Cupertino is also advertising the live-stream of WWDC on its front page.
* Apple previously announced that the five-day conference will focus on “the future of iOS and OS X,” and one blogger in the know has since cautioned the event is likely to see a larger OS X 10.10 presence because some iOS 8 features have apparently shifted back to iOS 8.1.
* Some hardware announcements (my money is on a Retina MacBook Air) are expected at the otherwise software-focused event, but probably not the iWatch or a new Apple TV, Re/code has learned.

* And should that Apple-Beats deal happen after all, expect to see Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre introduced as Apple executives at the Moscone West stage.
* Some of the new sessions include such topics as Women In Technology and Apps for China. All told, WWDC will host “more than 100 technical sessions, over 1,000 Apple engineers, hands-on labs to help developers integrate new technologies and fine tune their apps”.
* And as leaked in the official WWDC app for the iPhone and iPad, there will be a bunch of secret sessions with funny titles like ‘This is Still Under Wraps’, ‘All In Due Time,’ ‘No Comment Yet’, ‘We’re Not Telling Just Yet’ and more, as pictured on the above screeenshot.
* In the meantime, download some nicely done WWDC 2014 wallpapers for your iPhone and iPad. Up next: WWDC banners and decorations going up at Moscone West any day now.
* Don’t worry, we’ll keep you in the loop.
