* Yesterday we brought you news of a tremendous achievement where the App Store is concerned. Apple, amazingly, announced the fact that it had delivered an astonishing 25 billion downloads since the creation of the App Store in 2008.
* That truly is an amazing fact and we’re sure it won’t be long until the next milestone of 50 billion has come and gone. It took Apple just over a year to add a further 15 billion to its 10 billionth download back in January, 2011.
* If you were wondering what apps have been top of the pile during this success then look no further than the list below that is available on iTunes:
* Top Paid iPhone
* Top Free iPhone
* Top Paid iPad
* Top Free iPad
* You can view the all-time top app charts by following on a PC, Mac or iOS device, and if you’re really keen, you can even compare them to 2011’s chart here.
* Do you have any predictions on how long you think it will take for Apple to announce the 50 billionth app download?
