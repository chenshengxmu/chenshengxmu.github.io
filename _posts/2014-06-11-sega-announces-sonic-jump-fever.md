* If you enjoyed Sega’s Sonic Jump on your iPhone and iPad, you’ll want to put the official sequel called Sonic Jump Fever on your wish list. Arriving a year and a half after the original Sonic Jump remake (Sega’s first iOS exclusive), the follow-up is due for release this summer.
* The fast-paced, leaderboard-focused vertical jumping platformer will have you compete against friends for high scores, with a little help from boosters like Fever Mode (hence the name) that pushes your character into hyper-speed for some “earth-shattering scores”…
* As the game is all about topping each other’s scores, you must focus on boosters, upgrades and unique character abilities to pull off huge combos to maximize your score.
* The game has been developed by Hardlight, the same studio that brought you the endless runner Sonic Dash and the original Sonic Jump.

* Sega plans to reset global leaders boards twice per week to add a dash of variety and prevent same people from dominating charts. Each time you start a new level, the game will put up leaderboards with friends’ scores to check how you stack up against other players.
* Check out the trailer below.
* Sega promises that you’ll be playing as Sonic, Knuckles and a host of classic characters. “Earn points quickly and unleash Fever Mode which puts the player into hyper-speed for Earth-shattering scores,” reads the blurb.
* Sonic Jump Fever has already soft-launched in Australia, Canada and New Zealand and will be hitting international App Stores later this summer as a free-to-play download.
* An iPhone, iPod touch or iPad compatible with iOS 7.0 or later is required.
* In the meantime, check out Sonic Jump, a $2.99 universal iPhone/iPad download.
* And if you love Sega’s work, you should know that a brand new Super Monkey Ball game is due for release this summer, called Super Monkey Ball Bounce.
