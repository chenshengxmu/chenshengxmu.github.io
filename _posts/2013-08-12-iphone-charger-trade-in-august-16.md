* Earlier this month Apple launched Takeback Program, a trade-in initiative encouraging buyers to dispose of third-party (especially knock-off) USB power adapters and buy Apple’s chargers at a discount.
* The sudden and unexpected offer is in response to relentless reporting by China’s state-run media describing a fatality involving Chinese stewardess who electrocuted herself after using a knockoff charger to power her iPhone.
* Takeback Program started on August 9 in China and will roll out to United States this coming Friday, August 16. While it was initially thought the offer was US and China only, a reliable blogger has learned that’s not the case as Apple is gearing up to launch the trade-in program in its other key markets, including Canada, France, Germany and United Kingdom…
* Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac, who was able to get hold of training materials for Apple Store employees, notes the updated support pages showing the Apple USB Power Adapter discount pricing for markets beyond China and US.
* Over the past couple of days, Apple has updated its Support Page for the USB trade-in-program to note a few other supported regions and the corresponding discount pricing:
* Australia ($14 AUD), Canada ($11 CAD), France (10 €), Germany (10 €), Japan (￥1,000), and the United Kingdom (10 £).
* According to Gurman’s reliable sources, each Apple Retail Store will have at least one Genius on staff at all times to conduct the trade-ins for customers.

* Following media reports that 23-year-old China Airlines flight attendant Ma Ailun suffered a fatal electric shock when she answered a call using her iPhone that was recharging, Apple moved quickly by issuing a charger advisory recommending Chinese customers use the supplied USB power adapter and USB cable to charge their iOS devices.

* Soon after, the firm in a PR counteroffensive announced the Takeback Program on its website.
* According to the terms, customers can bring their suspect USB power adapter along with an iOS device to an Apple Store or participating Authorized Service Provider for recycling, or trade it in towards the purchase of an official Apple power adapter at a discounted price.
