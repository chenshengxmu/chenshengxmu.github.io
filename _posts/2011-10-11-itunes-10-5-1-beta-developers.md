* Hot on the heels of the iTunes 10.5 release to the general public a few minutes ago, Apple has also seeded iTunes 10.5.1 beta to developers.
* iTunes 10.5.1 beta 1 includes several performance enhancements and bug fixes, and is a required update for all subscribers to iTunes Match beta which is not included in the iTunes 10.5 GM release…
* The latest beta release is available from the iOS Dev Center. Unless you’re a developer, there is no reason to download iTunes 10.5.1 beta, which by the way is safe for jailbreakers.
