* Looking to save some of the precious moments you find on Instagram? If so, then SaveGram is a jailbreak tweak that you want to try today. It allows you to not only save photos from the people you follow, but also videos as well.
* After installing SaveGram, it just works, and there are no settings to configure. In fact, no preference panel exists in the Settings app for the tweak, and no app icons are placed on the Home screen.
* SaveGram is wholly contained within the Instagram app, and looks totally like a native feature. Once you’re viewing a photo or a video that you wish to save, simply tap the ellipsis button in the bottom right-hand corner of the photo page, and tap the new Save button and the bottom of the list. This will save the photo or video directly to the iOS Photos app.

* You’d be hard-pressed to find a simpler and more native method for saving IG photos. If you want to check out SaveGram, you can do so free of charge from the BigBoss repo on Cydia.
* What do you think? Would you consider using it?
