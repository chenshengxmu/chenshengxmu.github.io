* Scanbot, the popular document scanner and QR reader that Apple listed among its Best Apps in 2014, has received an update which allows you to add smart reminders and tasks via iOS Reminders and Evernote to your scanned documents, with alerts delivered via Push Notifications to the Lock screen.
* Secondly, Scanbot 3.5.1 brings out support for the login and password management app 1Password, making possible adding cloud services to Scanbot using data stored in 1Password. And thirdly, developers have implemented endless scanning by removing any limitations in terms of the amount of pages you can scan, allowing you to literally scan full books now.
* Reminders, which can be added to all new and existing documents in Scanbot, are handy because certain types of scans (like bills, receipts, expense reports or letters that need responding) require a follow-up action.
* In addition to the stock Reminders app and Evernote, support for “one more major task manager” is due in the upcoming weeks, developers said.
* This feature is only available to Scanbot Pro users.
* With 1Password integration (available to all), you can easily authorize cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote and OneDrive in Scanbot using your credentials stored in 1Password.
* Scanbot 3.5.1 changelog:
* The 44.3-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 7.0 or later.
* Scanbot is a freemium download from the App Store.
* A one-time $5 In-App Purchases unlocks Scanbot Pro with all of the features, with individual advanced features available for purchase as well.
