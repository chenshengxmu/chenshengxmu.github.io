* Google has updated its productivity mobile apps on the App Store—Docs, Sheets and Slides—that act as alternatives to Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. The new versions of these apps have added a brand new Trash view which lets you easily recover previously deleted documents, spreadsheets and presentations. In addition to Trash, the most recent updates to Docs, Sheets and Slides come with the usual bug fixes and performance improvements.
* To view and restore a previously deleted file in the Docs, Sheets and Slides for iPhone and iPad, tap Trash from the menu on the left side of the screen, then select an item you wish to recover from Trash.

* The apps may soon gain the ability to search for and insert GIFs in documents using Google’s GBoard keyboard because that feature was recently added to their Android counterparts.
* Grab Google Docs, Sheets and Slides free from the App Store.
