* Do you have an ongoing issue with accidentally launching the Lock Screen camera in iOS 5? If so, then perhaps this is the jailbreak tweak for you.
* LockscreenSureCam is a tweak that prompts you before launching the Camera on your Lock Screen. I don’t know anyone who’s ever had a problem with this, but I’m sure someone is out there that does. If that’s you, then check inside for a brief video walkthrough.
* LockscreenSureCam is a free jailbreak tweak on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and it requires a jailbroken iOS 5 device in order to use it.
* Most will probably deem this tweak as “worthless” but there’s no doubt somebody out there that is jumping with glee at this very moment. What do you think?
