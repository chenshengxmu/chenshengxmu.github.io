* The official Path iOS client received a major update last night, bringing the app to version 2.5. The update includes a number of changes, such as enhanced media sharing, an improved camera, and new photo editing tools.
* Path 2.5 also includes another cool addition that might just persuade folks to join the social network. New users now have the option to import data from their Facebook, Instagram, and Foursquare accounts into Path…
* First we’ll talk about the changes that current users can enjoy, and then we’ll get into the account importing. Here’s the 2.5 change log:
* These changes alone are worth the update, but new users will really like this. While setting up a new account in Path, you can now import your status updates, photos, check-ins and tips from your Facebook, Instagram and Foursquare accounts. That means you can have all of your social network data, in one place.

* Note that this feature is currently for new users only. So if you already have a Path account, you either need to create a new one, using a new email address, or you’ll have to hang tight. It’s assumed that Path will eventually open this up to all users.
* Path has been slowly rising in popularity over the past year, and is constantly praised for its iOS app (looking at you Facebook). If you want to see what all of the fuss is about, you can find Path in the App Store, for free.
* What do you think of the new update?
