* Apple’s iOS 9 mobile operating system is now installed on two out of each three iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices in the wild just a little over a month and a half following its September 16, 2015 release.
* According to the official stats available through the company’s App Store dashboard for developers, iOS 9 is now powering 66 percent of Apple’s mobile devices in active use versus the adoption rate of 61 percent recorded just two weeks ago.
* iOS 8 continues to power one-quarter of active devices, accounting for 25 percent of active devices the wild while earlier versions of iOS recorded a nine percent share. That’s a notable five percentage point drop for iOS 8 which just two weeks ago was detected on thirty percent of iPhones, iPads and iPod touches.

* Apple’s data was derived from logs capturing iOS devices that had accessed the App Store on November 2, 2015. The stats indicate that iOS 9 continues to grow as existing users upgrade from iOS 8 to the new software or upgrade to new devices that ship with iOS 9 preinstalled.
* By comparison, about three-quarters of Android smartphones and tablets that had accessed the Play store during a seven-day period ending on October 5, 2015 were running a version older than last year’s Android 5.0 Lollipop.
