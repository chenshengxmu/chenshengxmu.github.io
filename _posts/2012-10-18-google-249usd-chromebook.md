* I kinda like the concept of an Internet-only notebook which boots in a few seconds, is always on and runs smoothly. I wanted to like Google-branded Chromebooks and almost bought one before realizing that Apple has already ticked all the right boxes with its iPad computer. But if a portable computing device with a physical keyboard which runs a browser-based OS and runs only web apps is your thing, this new Chromebook surely will pique your interest.
* Apart from being a total rip off of the MacBook Air down to its black rounded keys, trackpad and the recess right where the lid opens, know that this Chromebook is a quarter of the Air’s asking price and half the iPad’s. On paper, the machine is a must-have: it weighs in at only 2.43 pounds, is 0.8-inches thick, runs 6.5+ hours battery and rocks a 11.6-inch display at a 1,366-by-768 pixel resolution.
* Per usual, there are some caveats that a flashy commercial (included below) fails to mention…
* The machine (via Endgadget) is built by Samsung and runs the Chrome OS on Samsung’s dual-core Exynos 5 chip which incorporates ARM’s Cortex-A15 CPU. Its firepower also stems from 2GB RAM, built-in WiFi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 3.0 and sixteen gigabytes of flash storage.
* It does 1080p video playback, has a front-facing webcam and comes with built-in Google Now and a hundred gigabytes of free Google Drive storage for two years. Other ports include a USB 3.0, another one supporting USB 2.0, an SD card slot and a headphone/mic jack.
* Google’s going all out with the laptop so expect to find it online via Amazon, PC World and of course Google’s own Play Store, as well as retailers like Best Buy.
* More info over at Google and in the official blog post.
* Here’s the official promo video.

* I’ve read the reviews and looks like hardware compromises won’t be for the faint-hearted.
* This here’s an excerpt from Stephen Shankland’s review for CNET:
* My current favorite browser torture test, panning across my nine columns of Twitter feeds in the Tweetdeck Web app, can be slow. And something I hadn’t seen before: initiating a new tweet often takes the Chromebook 5 or 6 seconds before a window appears where I can type. 
* GigOm’s Kevin C. Tofel agrees, noting the new ARM-based machine represents a step back from the previous generation Chromebooks built on the Intel platform.
* You seriously didn’t expect a speed demon for $249, right?

* The more powerful Series 5 550 Chromebook continues to be available from Google’s web store at $450.
* Now, the similarities between this Chromebook and Apple’s MacBook Air are particularly painful to ignore and Shankland agrees, politely pointing out:
* If the Chromebook Series 5 550 drew inspiration from a MacBook Pro, the new Chromebook did so from a MacBook Air. It’s cheaper, thinner, has a smaller 11.6-inch screen, and at under 2.5 pounds weighs less. Google plans to promote the new Chromebook more aggressively in stores and advertising.
* Then again, what did you expect from a company found guilty of ripping off iPhones and iPads wholesale. Before you jump straight to the comments, I guess you could also say that it’s hard to expect Samsung to learn its lesson when judges in the UK rule that Apple has to apologize to Samsung.
* Their previous Chromebook Series 5 550 did remind me slightly of the MacBook Pro, but this model is just too much for my taste. I’ll be passing on a $249 Chromebook and instead install Chrome OS on my MacBook Air via Parallels Desktop.
* Considering Google is going to promote the hell out of the $249 Chromebook as we head into holidays, perhaps Apple should be concerned?
