* Differences between the 4.7-inch iPhone 6/6s and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus are mostly confined to screen size, battery and optical image stabilization on the bigger model.
* With the next iPhone, this imaging gap between the regular-sized model and its 5.5-inch brethren is expected to widen by a significant margin.
* Purported iPhone 7 technical drawing discovered on Chinese forum Baidu by Italian-language HDBlog serves as yet another indication that the flagship iPhone 7 Plus model will be exclusively outfitted with a rumored dual-camera system, leaving the regular-sized iPhone 7 model with modest photography improvements stemming from a larger camera package.
* Eagle-eyed readers might point out that KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said as much back in April, writing in his research note that the dual-lens camera system would be found exclusively on the flagship iPhone 7 Plus model.
* Holes for the Smart Connector, another rumored iPhone 7 Plus exclusive, are suspiciously absent from the images below, leaked by the same source.

* Another feature that could be exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus: a 256-gigabyte model.
* Recent leaks have suggested that the unsightly camera bump on the iPhone 6/6s series should remain an integral part of the iPhone’s design for at least another year.
* Meanwhile, Apple’s supply chain is abuzz with news that Taiwanese suppliers are prepping to retool their manufacturing processes ahead of production of power-saving AMOLED screens for future iPhones.
* It’s highly unlikely we’ll see an OLED iPhone before the handset’s tenth anniversary next year.
* Curiously, the Cupertino firm looks confident that tens of millions of people will want to upgrade to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus when they arrive this fall: Taiwanese media said today that Apple has commissioned its suppliers to build between 72-78 million new iPhone units in 2016 alone, a significant increase over Wall Street’s prediction of 65 million units.
