title: Dismiss breadcrumb links in iOS 9 with a new jailbreak tweak

* One of the new features in iOS 9 is a new app linking structure. This allows you to navigate back to the originating app that linked you via a handy breadcrumb link in the upper left-hand corner of the status bar. Some people hate it, most love it, but I think all can agree that it’s a little awkward at times.
* Wouldn’t it be better if you could dismiss the breadcrumb link once you’ve arrived at a destination, and had no intentions of going back? BreadcrumbsAway is a new jailbreak tweak that lets you do just that. It allows users to dismiss breadcrumb links and regain the full status bar view in iOS 9.
* Once BreadcrumbsAway is installed, it’s simply a matter of opening an app link, and swiping left on the breadcrumb in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. When you do so, the link will disappear, and you’ll regain the ability to view your iPhone’s cellular signal and Wi-Fi signal.
* Make no mistake about it, I love iOS 9’s new linking mechanics. But I’ve come to realize that you don’t always need or have a desire to go back to the original destination. For times like this, it’s nice to be able to simply dismiss a breadcrumb link that you don’t need.
* BreadcrumbsAway is an excellent jailbreak tweak that everyone who’s jailbroken on iOS 9 should try. It’s available for free on the BigBoss repo, and has no options to configure upon installation.
* What do you think about BreadcrumbsAway?
