* Following a credible report earlier this morning claiming that the Mac’s Preview and TextEdit applications will make their way into iOS 8 with full iCloud support minus editing functionality, a pair of supposed screenshots allegedly depicting the iOS 8 Home screen has popped up on a Weibo account.
* The images, included below the fold, are believed to depict purported prototype iOS 8 Home screen icons for the previously rumored Healthbook app, as well as the suspected Preview and TextEdit applications. By the way, iOS 8 is thought to be codenamed ‘Okemo’ after a ski resort in Vermont.
* On the surface, the screenies look genuine. However, as we can’t vouch for their authenticity, you’re definitely advised to take them with a grain of salt, even though multiple reliable sources have allegedly confirmed their legitimacy.
* We’re only reposting them here for entertainment purposes so join us in comments…
* The images were first posted on this Weibo account.
* The reliable blogger Mark Gurman says he’s been able to confirm “with several sources” that these screenshots are indeed legit.
* The Preview icon looks a bit off to me.
* Before you guys jump straight to the comments – I know these could literally be Mac app icons thrown onto solid white and black backgrounds – it’s worth pointing out they’re likely work in progress (or just placeholders) and as such are definitely going to be redesigned in the coming months.
* And this is a Settings screen.

* So, what do you guys think?
* What’s that Tips icon, though?
* Is that an existing third-party item or yet another Apple app?
* If you can solve the mystery, do share your findings down in the comments.
