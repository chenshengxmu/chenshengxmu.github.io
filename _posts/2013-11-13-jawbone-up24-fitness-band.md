* Big news from Jawbone today. The accessory-maker behind the popular line of Jambox speakers introduced a new version of its UP fitness-tracking band, the UP24, as well as a big 3.0 update for its UP iOS app.
* While the new UP looks very similar to its predecessor, it does feature one significant hardware change: it now uses Bluetooth 4.0 to connect to your iOS device, instead of forcing you to plug into your audio port…
* That’s right, unlike the first two generations of the UP band, the UP24 allows you to sync data wirelessly. This answers the #1 complaint among UP users, and brings the tracker more in line with the competition.
* Unfortunately, despite its new found wireless feature, the band still has a headphone jack-style plug (and tiny plastic cap) for charging purposes. The good news, though, is that battery life is still impressive at 7 days.
* And that’s about it for notable differences in the new UP and last year’s model. Obviously the companion iOS app has changed a bit too to accomodate wireless data transfers, and it now focuses more on live feedback.

* Jawbone is selling the UP24 for $149 alongside the original, which will remain at $129. It comes in black and orange, and is available today on Jawbone’s website, and should start arriving at retailers next week.
