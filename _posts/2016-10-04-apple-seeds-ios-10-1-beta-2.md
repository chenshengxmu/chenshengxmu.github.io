* Apple on Tuesday issued the second beta for iOS 10.1. Registered developers can grab the new software via the over-the-air update mechanism in the iOS Settings app, or via Apple’s online developer portal.
* By far the most significant change in iOS 10.1 is the addition of Portrait camera mode— an iPhone 7 Plus-exclusive software feature that creates a ‘bokeh’ effect, which Apple demonstrated at last month’s event.
* Here’s an example of what a photo taken in Portrait mode looks like:

* And here’s TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino with a breakdown of how it works:
* The Portrait mode, which displays a beta notification prominently on first launch, resides to the right side of the standard photo mode in your camera app. There is no zooming, digital or otherwise, in Portrait mode. Instead, the Portrait mode exclusively uses the 56mm lens to shoot the image and the wide angle lens to gather the perspective data that allows it to generate a 9-layer depth map.
* We are installing the iOS 10.1 beta now, and will be sure to update this article with any significant new findings. If you find something new we haven’t mentioned, feel free to let us know down in the comments below!
