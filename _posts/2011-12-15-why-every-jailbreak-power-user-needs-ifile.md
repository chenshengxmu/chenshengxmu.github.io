* iFile — you’ve most likely heard of it, but do you use it? If you’ve ever used a Mac, then you’re familiar with Finder, and if you’re familiar with Finder, than you’re familiar with iFile.
* iFile is essentially the iOS version of Finder, or Explorer for Windows. But for jailbreakers, there’s a lot more here than meets the eye. Check inside for a video walkthrough accompanied by a good list of reasons as to why you should be using iFile.
* As you can see from the video, not only does iFile provide you with the basic ability to view your device’s root file structure, it does a whole lot more.
* You can install .deb packages directly from iFile: Without iFile, Safari throws up an error message whenever attempting to open a .deb file. After iFile, it asks you to open the file in iFile where you can then install it. Obviously, there are more complicated ways to install .deb packages, but this is by far the easiest most straightforward method to do so.
* You can transfer files: And no, we’re not talking about mere cable-based transfer, we’re talking Wi-Fi, we’re talking Bluetooth. Yes, iFile allows you to establish a Wi-Fi file server that you can connect to from any web browser running on the same Wi-Fi network. It also allows Bluetooth transfer between two iPhones running iFile.
* Editing files: Being that iFile acts like a Finder for iOS, it’s a no-brainer that you can edit files within the app. But the big difference is that you can edit any file within iOS, and you can edit property list files to perform more advanced hacks on your iPhone.
* Ladies and gentlemen, that’s just three reasons why I feel that iFile is a must have for every jailbreak power user, but there’s many more, as you will no-doubt see from our video walkthrough.
* Let me know, do you use iFile, or do you have some other means to accomplish the items explained above?
