* I don’t think many folks were expecting Apple to unveil any exciting new hardware at WWDC this year. The company has rarely used the developer conference to unveil non-software related products, outside of maybe refreshed MacBooks and other Mac products.
* But for those who were still holding out hope for a Jobs-like ‘one more thing,’ I have some bad news. According to a new report from Recode’s John Paczkowski, the company has no intention of using WWDC to show off the long-rumored iWatch or revamped Apple TV…
* Here’s Paczkowski with the report:
* If you’ve been anticipating the debut of some new category-defining hardware at Apple’supcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, a word of advice: Dial back your expectations or be disappointed. Sources familiar with Apple’s plans tell Code/red that Tim Cook will not use WWDC to unveil Apple’s mythical wearable device. Nor will he use it to show off a new Apple TV, or even preview the new software the company is developing for it.
* Again, no major surprise here, but it does pour some cold water on the hopes of those looking for Apple to veer off schedule next month. In recent years, the company has saved major product announcements like new iPhones, iPads and the iPad mini for the fall.
* So what will be discussed at WWDC? According to yesterday’s report from 9to5Mac, OS X will be the focus of the event, as it’s expected to get an iOS 7-style makeover. iOS 8 is also on the docket, but it’s unclear if Apple will unveil the long-rumored Healthbook app.
* WWDC kicks off June 2nd.
