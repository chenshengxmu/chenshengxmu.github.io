* Here is a jailbreak app that will sure make iPhone themers happy. Masks, a new application that lets you quickly and easily customize the look of your wallpaper and icons.
* Up until now, the best way to customize your springboard was by using WinterBoard. While a great application, WinterBoard can be a bit cumbersome: you have to search for a theme, download it, activate it in WinterBoard, and respring. Masks takes all that away by bringing to the table a new way to tweak your iPhone springboard…
* Masks is different from WinterBoard as you don’t have to download any theme. You just create yours thanks to a set of 40+ pre-made image masks for icons and wallpapers.
* So how does this work exactly? Each image (mask) is a simple white image with a black shape on it. The app takes that image and applies the shape to all your icons and wallpaper. Still confused about how it works? Watch the video below:
* Masks is available in Cydia for $1.99. Make sure to give it a try and share your feedback by leaving a comment.
