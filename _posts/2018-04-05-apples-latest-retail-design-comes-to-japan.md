* Apple is opening a brand new store outlet in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district.
* Earlier this morning ahead of grand opening Saturday the company shared some nice photographs showing off the store’s interior and exterior.
* The brinck-and-mortar store outlet, just blocks from Shinjuku Station in Tokyo’s famous shopping, business and entertainment district, brings Apple’s next-generation retail design, spearheaded by Jony Ive and Angela Ahrendts, to Japan for the first time.
* As evidenced by the photos Apple shared, the store connects seamlessly to the street outside with an expansive 37 meter glass storefront lined with local Longstock Holly trees.

* Like other major stores Apple opened or renovated in the past two years, Apple Shinjuku features sequoia wood tables and shelves, wooden cabinets for accessories, a massive 6K video wall with seating (called the “Forum”) and so-called “Avenues” with interactive displays for visitors to get hands-on with third-party products and accessories.
* Apple calls its stores Town Squares as they’re meant to be gathering places for the locals.

* This is the first of several new stores Apple has pledged to open in Japan.
* Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Retail, was quoted as saying:
* Apple has a long and special history in Japan and Shinjuku marks the first of several new stores we’ll open in Japan in the coming years. We can’t wait to welcome the vibrant community in Shinjuku to experience all the best Apple has to offer.
* In fact, Apple’s first international store opened in Tokyo’s Ginza neighborhood in 2003. It’s since welcomed 70 million visitors to its stores across the 128 million people country.
