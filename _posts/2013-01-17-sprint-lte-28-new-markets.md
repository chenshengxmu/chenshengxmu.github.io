* Great news today for Sprint subscribers who have been lusting for LTE. The carrier just announced plans for a major expansion of its new 4G network, that will see the service added to 28 new markets over the next few months including Branson, Missouri, and Columbus, Georgia. We’ve got the full list of cities after the break…
* In a blog post yesterday, Sprint announced that work has begun on its 4G LTE network in the following areas:
* Sprint launched its LTE network back in July of last year, putting it around 7 months behind AT&T and a year and a half behind Verizon. And that time difference has definitely put the carrier at a disadvantage, because while the other two providers have LTE coverage in 3 and 400 markets, Sprint just recently crossed 100.
* But the nation’s 3rd largest carrier does have one thing going for it that the others don’t: it’s currently still offering unlimited data plans, even with its new LTE service. Both AT&T and Verizon ditched their unlimited options last year in favor of new shared data plans, and have been urging customers on legacy plans to switch.
