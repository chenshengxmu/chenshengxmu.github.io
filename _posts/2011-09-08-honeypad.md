* Looking to add a bit of Android flair to your iPad? If you’re a DreamBoard connoisseur, then you’ve likely already stumbled upon HoneyPad, the theme that can turn your iPad into one of three flavors of Android.
* For those a little less cozy with DreamBoard and its theming abilities, what I’m about to show you may come as a bit of a shock…
* As you can see, HoneyPad allows you to turn your iPad into an Asus Eee Pad Transformer, a Motorola Xoom, or an HTC Flyer, with just a few taps.
* HoneyPad uses the popular and flexible DreamBoard framework to accomplish this feat, and it’s admittedly impressive.
* In fact, it’s probably good enough of a replica to fool any casual passersby, though most seasoned Android enthusiasts will quickly spot the counterfeit.
* One of my favorite aspects of HoneyPad is the ability to move the various widgets included with the package anywhere you please. I’m extremely impressed with the amount of options present, and DreamBoard never ceases to amaze me with how flexible and expandable it is.
* All that being said, this is still just a theme, and it’s probably not going to suite your fancy to outright replace iOS, even if you happen to prefer the way Android does things.
* Even with this in mind, you may deem the $2.99 asking price worth it to impress your friends and family.
* What do you think about HoneyPad? I’m interested in hearing your perspective on this theme, so let me know in the comments below.
