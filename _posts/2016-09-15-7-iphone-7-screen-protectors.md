* If you pre-ordered the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, or are hoping to score one in-store during launch weekend, you’re going to want to start thinking about accessories. We’ve already recommended some good cases and Bluetooth headphones, and now it’s time to talk about screen protectors.
* Despite its largely familiar design, the iPhone 7 features a few tiny changes (wider earpiece, for example) that likely mean your iPhone 6 and 6s screen protectors won’t fit properly. But never fear, we’ve rounded up some great, inexpensive options to help keep your screen scratch-free.
