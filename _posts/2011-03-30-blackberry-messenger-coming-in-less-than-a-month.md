* Earlier this month it was revealed that the ridiculously popular (among BlackBerry users of course) BlackBerry Messenger would be making its way to iOS.
* After the initial announcement, we haven’t heard much of a peep from the folks at RIM about the app’s progress, its release date, or any fears that their app might be outright rejected by the Apple.
* Yesterday, a poster on the MacRumors forums claimed that the release date for BBM will be April 26th, less than a month away.
* But wait, as iPhoneinCanada has pointed out, there might be more to this story than meets the eye…

* The poster on the MacRumors forums states that they attended a social media conference by means of their college, and that RIM was one of the attendants.
* They go on to state that RIM’s co-CEO Jim Balsillie revealed that BBM along with “other services” would be released on April 26th, and that it will feature a new notification system.
* Now while it’s true that RIM could be taking the low key approach to a product that may or may not receive Apple’s final stamp of authority when it goes before Apple’s approval minions, it strikes us as kind of odd that they would choose to take the subtle approach with a flagship app like BBM.
* In a time where RIM’s popularity and stock are waning from constant missteps and miscues, it would seem like they would want to garner as much attention from this announcement as they possibly could.
* Ex at iPhoneinCanada did some investigative work, and has found that the poster has a very questionable posting history, numerous locked threads, etc.
* So at the end of the day, while it might be true, it’s certainly not out of the realm of possibilities that this is just a fabrication by the original source. Get your Morton salt ready.
* What do you think? Think we’ll see BBM on April 26th?
