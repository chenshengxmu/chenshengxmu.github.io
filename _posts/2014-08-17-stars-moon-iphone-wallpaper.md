* Previous popular wallpapers included galaxy images. Our galaxy variant and starred night sky wallpaper posts were some of the most popular over our first year of Wallpapers of the Week. In the spirit of giving the readers more of what they want, this week we present another set of galaxy inspired wallpapers.
* Today, there is a pack of wallpaper posts highlighting a whimsical approach to the starry sky. From creatively placed moons, to clouds and even space ships, if you are into galaxies, possibly far, far away, step inside for your downloadsâ€¦
* The collection below was gathered by @iDeviceGFX, operated by @CenixNova. The iDevice twitter account shares wallpapers on a daily basis and I recommend checking out the timeline for some other excellent walls.
