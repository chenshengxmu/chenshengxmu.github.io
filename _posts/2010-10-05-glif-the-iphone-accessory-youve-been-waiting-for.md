* Glif is an upcoming iPhone 4 tripod and mount from the mind’s of Dan Provost and Thomas Gerhardt. Glif’s website describes the product as, “a simple iPhone 4 accessory with two primary functions: mounting your iPhone to a standard tripod, and acting as a kickstand to prop your phone up at an angle.”
* The device is a small, L-shaped piece of injection-mold plastic with an embedded tripod mount. Glif locks around the long-sided part of your iPhone and snaps into any standard tripod… 
* The device is also functional without a tripod for mounting your iPhone in all kinds of places. While there are other devices and DIY solutions for iPhone tripods and mounts such as the Gorillamobile or the MoviePeg, Glif looks to be the most elegant and functional accessory in this field.
* The Glif project is currently being funded for manufacturing and distribution, but three times the needed amount has already been pledged, so Glifs should start sliding off the production line anytime now.
* Visit Glif’s Kickstarter page to pledge and watch a video from the product developers. When you pledge you are also reserving a Glif when they ship. The estimated price will be around $20.
* Would you use this product?
