* Some people resort to using proxy servers to maintain internet privacy and to get around website blocks at educational institutions and/or at work. On the other hand, anyone who’s ever used a proxy server knows how cumbersome it can be.
* With a new jailbreak tweak called ProxySwitcher by iOS developer mbo42, toggling your favorite proxy server in iOS any time you’re connected to Wi-Fi just got a whole lot easier.
* Once installed, a new icon is added to the Status Bar that serves as your primary toggle switch for turning the proxy server on or off for a browsing session. The icon alerts you of the status of your proxy server connection by graying out when not in use.
* You can go into the Settings app to configure ProxySwitcher in depth:

* Here, you can:
* You can use just about any proxy server you might be accustomed to, whether it requires authentication or not; a good free good example of a proxy server is Hide.me.
* Not everyone needs a proxy server connection; especially if they’re already subscribed to a VPN service that secures their data as needed. Nevertheless, if you still use a proxy server and want an easier way to use it on demand, then ProxySwitcher could be a useful asset to have on your side.
* ProxySwitcher is available from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for $1.00 and works on jailbroken iOS 8, 9, and 10 devices.
* Worthy of note, if you have libstatusbar installed, you’ll have to uninstall it and install libstatus9 as a dependency instead.
