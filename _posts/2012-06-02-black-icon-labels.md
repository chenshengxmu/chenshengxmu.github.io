* Some jailbreak tweaks are immediately labeled as being worthless, and Black Icon Labels is one such tweak. I understand that there are a few users out there who will find this tweak handy, but most will probably claim otherwise.
* Black Icon Labels changes the color of your app icon labels from white to black, and nothing more.

* Black Icon Labels can be downloaded for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Let me know what you think about it in the comments below.
