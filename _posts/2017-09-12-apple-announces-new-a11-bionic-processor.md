* Included in the new iPhone 8 and 8 Plus is Apple’s powerful new processor, the A11 Bionic. Apple says it is the smartest, and most powerful processor ever in a smartphone.
* Apple has designed its own mobile processors for years. Last years A10 is being usurped this year with Apple’s latest and greatest, that they have dubbed the A11 Bionic.
* The bionic is a new, 6 core processor made up of 2 high performance cores, and 4 high efficiency cores. The high performance cores are 25% faster than those included in the A10, and the high efficiency cores are 70% faster than those in the A10.

* It isn’t just about the cores though. It has a new 2nd generation performance manger. This is what automatically switches between the processors based on what you are doing on your phone. If you are just passively reading, it switches to the high efficiency cores for better battery. Then when you jump to an intense game, it will move to the high performance cores. Even better, is the new 2nd generation performance manager can actually use all 6 cores at once when necessary.

* The new Apple-designed GPU is also significantly improved. It is 30% faster than the graphic processor in the A10. It does all that while also using less power for similar performance.
* The legendary cameras included in the iPhone also rely on the ISP, or Image Signal Processor, in the A11 Bionic. It is now more powerful than ever, which will result in significantly better pictures. It has faster autofocus in low light, new pixel processing for improved sharpness and texture, and for the first time, hardware enabled multi band noise reduction.
* That is a lot of words to say that this really will be the most powerful processor, and iPhone, Apple has ever produced.
