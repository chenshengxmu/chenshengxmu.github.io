* Apple’s Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller is now on stage at the iPhone 5 event, and is starting to run down the specifics of the new handset.
* Just as we expected, the phone features a 4-inch 1136 x 640 display, is extremely thin and is made of aluminum and glass. Oh, and it also supports LTE…
* Schiller just announced that the iPhone 5 will feature a number of wireless technologies. For starters, it will support HSPA+, DC-HDSPA, and yes, LTE. It’s a single chip, single radio, dynamic antenna. There’s now a single chip for voice and data, and a single radio chip.
* In the US, LTE will work on Sprint, Verizon and AT&T networks. In Canada, Rogers Telus, and Bell. Apple has also named carriers in Europe and other regions.
