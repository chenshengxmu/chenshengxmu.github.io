* In line with a report from Jefferies’ Peter Misek earlier this year, Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt issued a claim this morning that Apple will charge a $100 premium for the larger of two iPhone 6 models expected to launch this fall.
* In a research note to investors, McCourt said he is confident Apple will charge a $100 more for the 5.5-inch version of its new smartphone, citing higher-priced components and more complex production processes as reasons for the bump…
* While some folks have worried that the increase in price will put off potential customers, McCourt believes that a larger number of users will happily pay the additional cost for the bigger screen. And he says he has survey data to back this up.
* MarketWatch shares the note:
* A Raymond James research note, published Friday, found a growing number of iPhone users are willing to pay an extra hundred bucks for a phone with a larger screen.
* “Apple will likely charge a $100 premium for the 5.5 inch version that media reports have suggested will be available a few months after the 4.7 inch version,” Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt told clients in a note.
* “Our June consumer survey points to continued growth in the willingness of iPhone users to pay $100 more for a bigger screened iPhone, with now a full one-third of survey respondents willing to pay a $100 premium,” he added.
* It’s worth noting that we don’t know the context or scope of McCourt’s survey, and for what it’s worth, our own poll showed around 60% of voters would not pay an extra $100 for a larger iPhone. But the analyst isn’t alone in his bold predictions.

* Many market watchers believe the iPhone 6 is going to smash performance projections for several reasons, including pent-up demand for a larger iPhone, major new features introduced in iOS 8, and compatibility with Apple’s upcoming wearable.
* Evidence thus far has pointed to Apple unveiling two new iPhones this fall: a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch model. Both versions are said to feature higher resolution displays, faster processors and other improvements, and could launch as early as September.
* So, we have to ask again. Would you pay an additional $100 for a 5.5-inch iPhone? Or is 4.7-inches enough?
