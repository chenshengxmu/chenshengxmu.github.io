* It’s been a busy week for the folks over at Sprint. Not only did the carrier rebrand itself as the Sprint Corporation, and complete its buyout deal with SoftBank, but today it announced two new rate plans that include unlimited talk, text and data.
* While the unlimited data itself is notable—few carriers still offer this—the real highlight of the plans is the lifetime guarantee. That’s right, in a world where the rules seem to change every other year, Sprint is promising unlimited everything, forever…
* From the press release:
* “Sprint (NYSE: S), the long-time leader in offering unlimited wireless services, is launching The Sprint Unlimited GuaranteeSM. The Sprint Unlimited Guarantee guarantees customers unlimited talk (calls to any wireline or mobile phone), text and data while on the Sprint network, for the life of the line of service. This guarantee is applicable to both new and existing customers who sign up for Sprint’s new Unlimited, My Way plan or My All-in plan. These plans and The Sprint Unlimited Guarantee are available starting July 12.”
* With the new My Way plan, Sprint customers can get unlimited talk, text and data for as low as $80 per month. And they can add a line to that for an additional $40 per month (not including data), two lines for $30 extra per month, or three lines for $20.

* With the My All-in plan, customers get everything listed above, as well as hotspot functionality with a 5GB monthly data allowance. If you don’t need 5GB, you can add the hotspot feature a la carte to the My Way plan for $10 a month for 1GB.
* According to Sprint, its customers will save $240 per year over Verizon customers, and $120 per year over AT&T and T-Mobile with these new plans. And as aforementioned, they’ll be available—with the lifetime guarantee—starting July 12.
* It’s actually a very interesting time to be a wireless subscriber in the US. Sprint’s announcement comes hot on the heels of T-Mobile’s big ‘Jump’ promo, which will let customers upgrade their devices up to twice a year. Verizon, AT&T, your move guys.
