* Since Facebook announced last week that it would be acquiring WhatsApp for $16+ billion, pundits have been trying to make sense of the deal. How can a messaging app startup be worth so much more than say, Motorola Mobility, which has thousands of employees?
* According to Mark Zuckerberg, it’s not. It’s worth more. Speaking at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona yesterday, the CEO said that WhatsApp was a ‘great fit’ for his company and that it was worth more than the $19B ($16B + $3B in vested shares) they paid for it…
* Bloomberg reports:
* Facebook Inc. (FB) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said WhatsApp Inc., which his social-media company agreed to buy last week, was “worth more than $19 billion. The mobile-messaging startup was “a great fit for us,” Zuckerberg said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona yesterday. “Already almost half-a-billion people love using WhatsApp for messaging and it’s the most engaging app we’ve ever seen exist on mobile by far.”

* The acquisition, which consists of $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares, and $3 billion in shares that will vest over the next several years, is the largest ever by the 10-year-old Facebook. It’s also the most expensive for an Internet company since the early 2000’s.
* “WhatsApp is well on its way to connecting 1 billion people, Zuckerberg said, and few services in the world attain that reach without becoming valuable. WhatsApp has more than 450 million users a month.
* “I think by itself it’s worth more than $19 billion,” he said. “It’s hard to exactly make that case today because they have so low revenue. … I could be wrong—there is some chance that this is the one service that gets to a billion people and ends up not being that valuable—[but] I don’t think I am.” 
* Will Mark’s gamble pay off? Who knows. It doesn’t sound like he’s interested in putting ads in WhatsApp or raising its subscription fee of $1 per year, so monetization is still a major question. But I guess if nothing else, it makes for one less messaging competitor to worry about.
* What do you think?
