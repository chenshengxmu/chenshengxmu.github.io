* If there’s one thing I didn’t expect to hear today, it’s Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam give his approval to the AT&T/T-Mobile merger initiated earlier this year.
* Of course, the potential business deal has been under scrutiny by the US Government, but AT&T intends to fight all the way to make the deal go through. Their argument? AT&T itself isn’t happy with its network, and the company needs T-Mobile’s network to increase its reliability. Surprisingly, Verizon agrees with that…
* At an investor conference yesterday, Verizon’s CEO said:
* “I have taken the position that the AT&T merger with T-Mobile was kind of like gravity. It had to occur, because you had a company with T-Mobile that had the spectrum but didn’t have the capital to build it out. AT&T needed the spectrum, they didn’t have it in order to take care of their customers, and so that match had to occur.”
* McAdam said that he’d told the Federal Communications Commission that not approving the deal would ultimately harm American consumers.
* A strong endorsement that might just be what AT&T needs, especially when Sprint is publicly making a case against the deal.
* Why do you think Verizon CEO is approving of the deal?
