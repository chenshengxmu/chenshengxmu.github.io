* There are so many VPNs to choose from, and if you’re having trouble deciding what one to choose for your own internet privacy and security, then we’re here to help.
* One of the biggest deciding factors in purchasing a long-term commitment to software is the cost, so in this roundup, we’ll discuss some of the best VPN deals you can get right now.
* Although free VPNs are undoubtedly the easiest on your wallet, they’re not exactly the toughest on your privacy and security, so we don’t particularly recommend them. For that reason, we’ll focus on some of the most fairly-priced paid VPN options available at this point in time in this piece.
* If you’re unsure what a VPN is or how to use one, then allow me to point you to our in-depth piece on why and how to use a VPN before you read on any further.
* When looking for a budget-friendly VPN, you typically want to find one where you only have to pay once to use it. Recurring payments that come from subscription-based models will add up and may surpass the prices of one-time payments.
* Nevertheless, amid the recent governmental decision to block the FCC’s bid for internet privacy in the United States, many VPN providers (including subscription-based ones) are offering limited time sale prices that might be worth the investment.
* Price isn’t necessarily everything though, so be sure to pay attention to device limitations, as some VPNs  limit the number of devices you can use with a single subscription.
