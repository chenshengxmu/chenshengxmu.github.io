* Twitter updated its popular 6-second clip-sharing app Vine today for iOS. The update brings the client to version 2.2, and features a handful of noticeable changes including a redesigned navigation menu and new sharing options.
* The redesigned navigation UI is one of biggest changes to Vine since its inception. The drop-down menu that lived in the Home icon in the top left-hand corner of the app has been replaced by a standard, bottom navigation bar… Here are the release notes:What’s New in Version 2.2.0
* • Get around the Vine app faster with a new navigation tab bar • More video viewing room: the top bar now scrolls away for more space. • Choose to share a Vine publicly or as a message right from the share screen.
* We’ve also included the usual bug fixes and improvements. As always, our line is open to you – just reach out to @vinehelp on Twitter with your comments and suggestions.
* Today’s update also includes improved notification controls. You can now customize notifications via the Notifications menu in Settings, picking which types of things you are alerted of—Likes, Comments, Revines, etc.—and how you are alerted.

* Additionally, Twitter has added support for new languages: Arabic, Hebrew, and Farsi (Android only). And with the new sharing option, you can now create a video and then decide where to send it, rather than picking a destination first.
* Today’s update makes it much easier to bounce around the app, and I recommend that anyone with a Vine account upgrade. You can find the latest version of Vine in the App Store for free. Unfortunately, it’s still just iPhone-only.
