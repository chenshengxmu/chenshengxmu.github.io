* Yesterday, the Dev Team released their RedSn0w untethered jailbreak tool for iOS 4.3.2. While the jailbreak was working fine with most devices, there seemed to be issues with the iPhone 4, which would randomly get stuck on reboot.
* With the help of i0n1c, the Dev Team fixed RedSn0w and updated it to version 0.9.6rc14. If you already ran 0.9.6rc13, you can simply download RedSn0w 0.9.6rc14 and run it over the previous one…
* RedSn0w 0.9.6rc14 with work with all devices on iOS 4.3.2, except for the iPad 2.
* If you’re not sure how to use this tool, make sure to check out our RedSn0w tutorial. As usual, you can download the latest version of RedSn0w from our downloads section.
