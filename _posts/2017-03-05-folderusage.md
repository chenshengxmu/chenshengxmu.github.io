* Have you ever wondered how much storage space the apps inside of a particular folder on your Home screen are using? If so, you might be interested in a new free jailbreak tweak called FolderUsage by midey.
* With this tweak installed, you can use a simple swipe-up gesture on any of your folder icons and this invokes a pop-up that displays the storage space being occupied by all of the apps contained within it.
* FolderUsage lets you see a report of how much space a specific group of apps is using on your device. This works differently from the storage space usage page in the Settings app, which only breaks things down on a per-app basis, rather than a per-folder basis.
* The tweak can be useful when you’re trying to keep track of how much storage space you’re dedicating to certain app archetypes, such as games.
* Since many people tend to put all of their games into folders, it’s nice to be able to keep track of how much space is being used for games alone, ensuring you never over-step your storage threshold and always have enough space for other things.
* While games aren’t the only example of how this tweak can be used effectively, it all comes down to how you use your device.
* FolderUsage is available for free right now from Cydia’s BigBoss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 8, 9 and 10 devices. There are no options to configure, so you’ll be able to start swiping up on your folder icons immediately after installation to discern storage space usages.
* How would you use FolderUsage? Share in the comments below.
