* Apple is planning an iPad event for Thursday, October 16, according to a new report from Recode’s John Paczkowski. Citing sources familiar with the plans, Paczkowski says the event will be held in the company’s Town Hall Auditorium in Cupertino, and will be used to talk about new iPads, new iMacs and of course, OS X Yosemite.
* The report notes that this will be a much more laid-back affair, compared to the spectacle that was Apple’s iPhone 6/Apple Watch event, without any mysterious white structures. This is further evidenced by the venue choice—the Town Hall location is far more intimate than the Flint Center, which could hold over 2,400 occupants.
* Admittedly, Thursday seems like an odd day for an Apple event, as the company has typically favored Mondays and Tuesdays in the past for its keynotes. But given Paczkowski’s nearly flawless (possibly flawless) track record for pinpointing unannounced Apple event dates, it’s hard not give his prediction some serious weight.
* As for what we expect to see at the event, new iPads will likely be a headliner, with Touch ID Home buttons and possible new gold colorway. The iMac refresh could be a big hit as well, however, as recent reports claim it could finally feature a Retina display. Apple could also mention iOS 8.1, which is slated to land around that time.
* Update: Bloomberg corroborates the story.
