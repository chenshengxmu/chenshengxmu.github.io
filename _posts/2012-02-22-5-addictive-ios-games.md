* I’m not a massive gamer, I leave that to my son. However I do like the odd iOS game thanks to the fact you can pick it up and play pretty much anywhere you want. Unfortunately some of these little games are addictive as hell and take up way too much of my work time.
* So enjoy 5 of the most addictive iPhone games that I’m digging right now:
* Try and bat your way past the Bowlomatic 3000 Robot as he throws some of the sneakiest balls in cricket history. There are various different levels including big stumps, X6 multiplier, evil eye and invisiball. The aim of the game is simple: score as many runs and reach the furthest level you can. Once you pick this up, you won’t put it down for a while. It’s the game that’s easy to play but hard to master.

* $0.99 in the App Store
* Smash Cops is refreshingly innovative when it comes to driving sims on the iPhone. Obviously if you’re looking at graphics, you’re instantly going to think of games such as Real Racing or Need For Speed. But where this game wins in my opinion is the ‘push’ driving controls. By placing your finger behind the car you can steer, weave, defend, and attack runaway felons with full control of your vehicle. It’s quite satisfying smashing into cars as well.

* $2.99 in the App Store
* Temple Run is a new addition to my games folder. It’s extremely addictive and mind numbingly good fun. This has taken over my Angry Birds fettish as my go to game when I have a spare 10 minutes. The idea of the game is quite simply to test your reflexes as you race down ancient temple walls and along sheer cliffs. Swipe to turn, jump and slide to avoid obstacles. Collect coins, buy power ups, and see how far you can run.

* Free in the App Store
* First off you will have to forgive me. I don’t usually promote anything in this kind of price range, however, I was a massive fan of SoulCalibur back in the days, and the guys at Namco have put a huge amount of effort into the game so I’m throwing this one into the mix. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the game-play is super satisfying. In total, there are 19 characters from the original game and the moves are authentic.

* $14.99 in the App Store

* Seeing as the last entry will take a chunk out your wallet, we will end on another freebie. Just because it’s free doesn’t mean you suffer in game-play, graphics or longevity. I’ve had Jetpack Joyride on my phone for quite a few months now and I still keep going back to it. After you lift-off, simply touch the screen to ascend and release to descend, raining bullets, bubbles, rainbows and lasers downwards as you fly towards higher and higher scores. There is plenty to keep you entertained with this one.
* Free in the App Store
* There you go. Five games that are seriously taking up way too much of my time. I would love to know what games you can’t put down in the comments below.
