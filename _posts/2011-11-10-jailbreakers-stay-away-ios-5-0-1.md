* We’ve told you before, but it doesn’t hurt to say it again. As MuscleNerd just confirmed on Twitter moments ago, and as we told you yesterday, you should stay away from the iOS 5.0.1 update if you are a jailbreaker/unlocker.
* Not only does iOS 5.0.1 patch exploits that could potentially allow for an untethered jailbreak, but there is also currently no way to downgrade from iOS 5.0.1 should you need to restore from a jailbreak…
* You’ve been warned!
* Now, if you don’t care about a jailbreak or unlock, please go ahead and download iOS 5.0.1.
