* The Dev Team recently confirmed there will not be a jailbreak for iOS 4.0.2 because iOS 4.1 is right around the corner and really, it would be a waste of time, but most importantly, a waste of exploit. This being said, I bet our favorite team of hackers is currently working hard on the iOS 4.1 beta release, trying to find a hole in there.
* When asked on Twitter whether the 4.1 jailbreak will be a userland one (just like Spirit and JailbreakMe), MuscleNerd answered that it might, assuming Comex can pull it off, or else it might just be a good old jailbreak like RedSn0w and PwnageTool.
* Obviously time will tell. However a little bird tells me Comex has more than one trick up his sleeves and I came to believe the next iOS 4.1 jailbreak will be a userland jailbreak as well.
* What do you think?
