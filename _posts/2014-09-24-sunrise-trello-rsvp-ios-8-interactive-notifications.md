* Wednesday morning, Sunrise Calendar received its iOS 8 focused update bringing out new capabilities to the already feature-packed cross-platform app.
* These include support for the free web-based project management service Trello and the ability to RSVP to invitation notifications by swiping on the notification directly (requires iOS 8).
* With support for Trello, Sunrise now lets you see all the cards with a due date and introduces a new option to filter for cards that are assigned to you.
* The ability to respond to meeting alerts by swiping on the notification directly requires iOS 8 which allows developers to create notifications that can be interacted with on the Lock screen, within the Notification Center or by pulling down on the notification banner.
* This is quite handy as you can respond to a meeting invitation without having to open the Sunrise app. Note that this particular feature is currently only available for Google Calendar users.
* Sunrise Calendar is available free of charge for the iPhone and iPad in the App Store, Mac notebooks and desktops in the Mac App Store, on the web at calendar.sunrise.com and on other platforms.
* If you’re a user, keep in mind that you can extend Sunrise’s functionality by connecting third-party apps: simply choose the Add Account option within the app’s settings interface.

* And if you want to add calendars for major holidays, sports and other events like the ones you see above, use the Interesting Calendars feature in the settings.
* Earlier this month, Sunrise developers have implemented such features as search, push for Google Calendar, Todoist integration and more.
