* Pinterest pushed out a new build of its mobile client this evening, bringing the iOS app to version 3.8. The update offers only one new feature, but it has the potential to change the way people use the service: messaging.
* That’s right, now whenever someone sends you a Pin, you have the ability to reply back with either a Pin of your own, or a direct message. It works with multiple users too, making planning a group trip or project a breeze…
* Here’s more on the new messaging feature from Pinterest’s blog:
* More good news: you can also send Pins and messages to multiple people. Say you’re organizing a camping trip with friends—try sending Pins to the whole gang so you can figure out where to go and what meals to make. If you need a reminder of who’s bringing what, just pull up the conversation right from your notifications. We hope this will help you plan projects, swap creative ideas and share your best discoveries with each other.
* And here’s a video showing the new feature in action:
* Once you’ve initiated messaging, you’ll notice an avatar pop up, similar to Facebook’s Chat Heads. The feature supports groups of up to 10 people, as well as Pinterest’s Guided Search option, letting you track down content on the fly.
* As a Pinterest user, I have to say I really like how the service and its subsequent apps are evolving. If you haven’t yet, I recommend checking out the latest version of the Pinterest app for iOS, which you can find in the App Store for free.
