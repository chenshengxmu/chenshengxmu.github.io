* The Google-owned Waze updated its iOS app today, bringing the crowdsourced mapping software to version 3.9.2. Don’t let that build number fool you, however, as the update brings about some significant changes.
* Perhaps the most notable addition is the new Waze Today Widget for iOS 8 devices. The widget allows you to quickly view your ETA for Home or Work, navigate with one tap, and easily send your current drive & ETA.
* Other changes include design tweaks that make sending “I’m on my way” messages, and your location, easier, as well as richer traffic info for ETA & route changes. The app also now auto-switches between 2D and 3D views.
* Today’s update follows another big release in September, which added an automatic parking spot-saving feature and the ability to add photos of places. You can find the latest version of Waze in the App Store for free.
