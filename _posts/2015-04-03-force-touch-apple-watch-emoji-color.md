* American model and activist Christy Turlington-Burns has posted her third blog entry about on Apple’s website, revealing a few previously unknown tidbits about the Apple Watch.
* The finding that caught my attention deals with Force Touch, a technology involving pressure-sensitive electrodes around the display that can distinguish between a touch and a press to show hidden options.
* Among other things, it’s possible to use Force Touch to easily change the color of animated emoji in instant messages.
* Christy, who was born and raised in California but is currently preparing to run the London Marathon, paid a visit to her US friends and family this week and used the device to stay in touch with her sons.

* “While we were apart, my daughter and I were sending animated emoji to the boys,” she said. “The faces are the best because they’re so expressive. If you press the screen, you can change the color,” she continued.

* In another revelation, Christy wrote that the device is capable of capturing a user’s heart rates extremely accurately by flashing its LED lights on the back “hundreds of times per second”.
* Christy’s previous blog entry has confirmed that the device can learn about its user’s stride enough over time to start accurately track workouts without an iPhone.
