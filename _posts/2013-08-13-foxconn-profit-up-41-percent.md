* Although Apple didn’t really wow investors with its overall Q3 numbers, there was one particular metric it blew out of the water: iPhone sales. Wall Street was predicting the company to sell between 25 and 27 million handsets during the period, and it sold 30 million.
* And the strong iPhone sales not only helped Apple post a $6.9 billion profit for the quarter, but it also gave Foxconn a boost as well. According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, the manufacturer’s profits surged 41% last during its Q2 thanks to Apple…
* The Journal’s Lorraine Luk reports:
* “TAIPEI—Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., 2317.TW +2.06% assembler of Apple Inc.’s AAPL +4.75% iPhones and iPads, posted a 41% rise in second-quarter net profit, helped by strong iPhone sales.
* But the profit jump is unlikely to soothe concerns that the company, which earns more than 40% of its revenue from Apple, faces challenging times ahead as Apple’s growth momentum slows. Hon Hai’s shares, traded in Taiwan, have fallen about 12% since the beginning of 2013, mirroring Apple’s losses earlier this year on concerns over customer fatigue with iPhones and iPads. The benchmark Taiex stock-market index gained 3.6% during the same period.”
* Foxconn said Tuesday that its net profit rose to 16.98 billion New Taiwan dollars (or $566.7 million USD) for the three month period, which ended June 30, from NT$12.06 billion last year. This was good enough to beat out analysts’ estimates of NT$16.32 billion.

* This is good news for the manufacturer, who back in June said that it was looking to diversify its business due to a lack of Apple product launches. The company earns 40% of its revenue from Apple, and its profits looked bleak without a new iPhone or iPad in sight.
* But the drought is decidedly over. The fall is approaching, and the Cupertino company is expected to release a slew of new products this quarter. In fact, Foxconn has been on a hiring spree in recent months, picking up 90,000 workers to help it build the new iPhone.
