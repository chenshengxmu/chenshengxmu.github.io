* This fall, Mac owners will at long last be able to converse with Siri as the voice-activated personal assistant makes its way into OS X 10.12, the next major release of Apple’s mobile operating system that powers Mac desktops and notebooks.
* According to 9to5Mac’s reliable Mark Gurman, “Apple currently plans to use its next major release of the Mac operating system this fall to continue to expand Siri across its product lines.”
* The news will no doubt make Mac owners happy. Siri, which debuted in 2011, is currently available across the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, Apple Watch and the new Apple TV. It makes a lot of sense to bring Siri to the Mac given that processing power and battery life on desktop is much better than on mobile devices.
* “For 2016, Siri is planned to finally make its way to the Mac,” notes Gurman.
* According to his sources, Siri for Mac has a polished interface and will sit in your Mac’s menu bar, dutifully awaiting your command. You will activate her by clicking the Siri icon in the top right corner of the menu bar, much like you bring up the Spotlight user interface or the Notification Center.
* “When a user clicks the Siri button, a dark, transparent Siri interface will appear in the top right corner of the screen,” reads the article.
* On Macs connected to power, you will be able to activate the feature with a “Hey Siri” command. Users will be presented with the option to enable Siri at the first startup of OS X 10.12, according to Gurman’s sources.
* Oh, and it’s “nearly ready to launch” publicly.
* OS X 10.12, internally code-named “Fuji,” should be previewed this summer at the WWDC 2016 alongside iOS 10, ahead of its public release in the fall. Among other things, the software update is said to include minor user interface tweaks across core system application windows and will continue to focus on improving performance.
* In your view, would Siri for Mac make for a meaningful feature addition?
