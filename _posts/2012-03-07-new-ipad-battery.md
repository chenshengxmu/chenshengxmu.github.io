* Something the iPad has always been able to claim is great battery life. Both the first and second generations of the tablet have had a 10 hour battery — meaning you could practically use the thing for 10 hours straight before it died.
* But with the new iPad’s upgraded hardware, a lot of folks have wondered if it would be able to hold around that 10 hour mark. I mean, between a new Retina display, quad-core processor and 4G LTE, it can’t possibly maintain great battery life. Can it?
* Yes. Apple has just announced that the new iPad will still last through 10 hours of continuous usage. And even more incredible — users will be able to browse for 9 hours when using LTE.
* That’s huge when you think about it. LTE is a well-known battery-hog, and devices using the technology typically last less than 6 hours. Heck, companies have even admitted that they regret trading LTE for battery life in their handsets and tablets.
* Well it looks like Apple cracked the code, to give users both.
