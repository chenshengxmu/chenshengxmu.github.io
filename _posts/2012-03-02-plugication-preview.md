* Tweaks like these are the reason why I love jailbreaking so much. Jailbreaking allows you to add obvious features to the iPhone that Apple may have looked over, or purposely omitted.
* Plugication is the perfect example of what I’m talking about. It’s a jailbreak tweak that forces your music to resume when you plug your headphones back into your device.
* Check out our full video demonstration of Plugication inside…
* The wonderful thing about Plugication is that it not only works with the stock Music app, but 3rd party apps like Spotify as well.
* Plugication is still unreleased, but rest assured we’ll be back with additional details once it hits Cydia.
* What do you think?
