* Apple on Thursday updated its App of the Week promotion with the game Super Phantom Cat. This means that for the next 7 days, you can download this popular retro platformer for both iPhone and iPad for free—a solid savings of $2.
* This charming side scroller is beloved for its beautiful retro graphics and whimsical character design, retro styling, and easy Mario-esque controls. It also features an awesome chip tune soundtrack, unlockable characters, and bonus levels.
* From the App Store Editors’ Notes:
* With its endearing art style and Mario-esque gameplay, this platformer had us purring in no time. Each cleverly devised level holds scores of hidden pickups and cute-but-lethal foes to dodge or pounce on. Robots fling you to high-up areas, fireball power-ups let you shoot obstacles, and funny messages fill the Phantom World with quirky appeal.
* And here’s a clip of the game in action:
* Super Phantom Cat is available in the App Store for free.
