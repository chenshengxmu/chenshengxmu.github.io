* A quick note for our readers that have been patiently waiting for a jailbreak for the Apple TV third generation. According to a recent tweet by my fellow countryman and iOS hacker extraordinaire Pod2g, no one is currently working on a jailbreak for the Apple TV 3.
* This doesn’t really come as a surprise. The Apple TV has always been the iOS device with the least amount of attention from jailbreak hackers, likely because it is much less exciting than the iPhone or iPad…
* The latest Apple TV to have received the jailbreak treatment is the Apple TV 2nd generation. As you can see in our jailbreak section, you can currently jailbreak the Apple TV 2 running iOS 5.1.1 using Seas0nPass.
