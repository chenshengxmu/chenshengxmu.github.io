* Apple’s recently said it would push back some pretty major new features in iOS 12 to 2019, including an overhauled Home screen with a redesigned grid of app icons, but the rumored ability for Macs to run iPad apps is still on track for this year’s software updates.
* That’s according to both Bloomberg and Axios.
* “Core features like the combined app platform are still on schedule to be introduced this year,” Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said yesterday.
* “Apple’s push for performance and security improvements over new features will also apply to this year’s Mac software, but one key feature remains on the roadmap for 2018: the ability for Macs to run iPad apps,” Ina Fried of Axios wrote today.
* “A new project around security” sounds like Apple’s new privacy icon in iOS 11.3 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.4, but don’t quote me on that.

* Bloomberg reported last December that Apple had an internal project going that would permit apps to run across iOS and Mac devices, a significant undertaking that would almost certainly add a high degree of complexity to this year’s iOS and macOS releases.
* “Software developers will be able to design a single app that works with a touchscreen or mouse and trackpad depending on whether it’s running on the iPhone and iPad operating system or on Mac hardware,” the news organization claimed.
* Apple could be actually enhancing its universal binary feature with expanded support for both iOS and macOS code rather than developing a combined iOS/macOS app platform.
* Codenamed “Marzipan,” this secret project is reportedly planned as a multiyear effort that could be formally announced at the company’s annual developers conference in the summer.
* The plan to delay some iOS and macOS features in favor of software stability was announced to key Apple engineers at a retreat earlier this month by software chief Craig Federighi.
* “On the Mac side, this is taking the form of a new project around security as well as improvements in performance when waking and unlocking the system,” according to Axios.
* Would a combined iOS/macOS app platform make sense, do you think?
