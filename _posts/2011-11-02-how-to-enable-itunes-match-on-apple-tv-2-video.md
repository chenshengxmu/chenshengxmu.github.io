* So by now you’ve probably heard the news: Apple has released iTunes 10.5.1 beta 2, and along with it comes iTunes Match Support for Apple TV 2.
* But how do you go about enabling iTunes match on the Apple TV? It’s actually much easier than one would expect.
* Check out our video demonstration of iTunes Match on Apple TV inside…
* Step 1: Download and install iTunes 10.5.1 beta 2 (You must be a developer)
* Step 2: Enable iTunes match by going to Store > Turn On iTunes Match in iTunes
* Step 3: Wait for iTunes Match to finish processing your music. (At least wait until it begins uploading the music and artwork it can’t match.)
* Step 4: On your Apple TV go to Settings > General > iTunes Store and enable iTunes Match
* Step 5: You will see a new “Music” section in your list. iCloud music will configure itself, and then you should be able to start playing your music.
* Have you tried out iTunes Match on your Apple TV 2? If so, let us know what you think about it.
