* A sketchy rumor originating from sources in China has it that Apple is currently experimenting with at least five different iPhone 7 configurations, each with its own unique hardware characteristics.
* Some of the features Apple is reportedly testing out for the next iPhone include a USB Type-C connector compatible with wireless headsets, wireless charging, multi-touch-capable Force Touch technology, dual cameras and a next-generation Touch ID technology embedded within the display.
* The same source reiterates that Apple is experimenting with AMOLED display technology. Barron’s recently said that some iPhones starting from 2018 will use AMOLED screens, with Samsung Display apparently discussing a possible collaboration with Apple to supply these screens.
* “Apple plans to introduce organic light-emitting diode displays for iPhones starting in 2018, sending suppliers racing to fine-tune the technology and invest in capacity expansion,“ reads the Nikkei report cited by Barron’s.
* Like other handset vendors, Apple tests a number of different iPhone prototypes before deciding on one that goes in production. That being said, the source of this rumor is unproven so you should take the report with a few pinches of salt.
* What hardware features would you like to see on iPhone 7?
