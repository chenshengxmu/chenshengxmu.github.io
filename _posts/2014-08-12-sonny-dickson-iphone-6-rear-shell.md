* Although everyone’s favorite parts leaker, Australia-born Sonny Dickson, has remained mostly mum in terms of iPhone 6 component leaks this year, Tuesday morning he took to Twitter to share high-resolution photos of an alleged iPhone 6 rear shell which seem to match up nicely with the leaks we recently saw.
* In addition to the antenna breaks at the top and the bottom replacing the glass cutouts seen on the iPhone 5/5s, the images appear to depict an iPod touch-style protruding lens for the device. Also clearly visible on the photos: a circular dual-LED flash module that Apple calls ‘True Tone’ flash…
* Shared on Twitter, a pair of images seemingly depict an all-metal backplate. For what it’s worth, the scuffed-up part appears virtually identical to the photo and video of the assumed iPhone 6 rear shell that luxury modified iPhone vendor Feld & Volk shared recently on its Instagram account.
* Standard disclaimer applies here: take the image with a truckload of salt as Disckson has been wrong before. And unlike previous pre-production components, this particular part lacks any brand name or regulatory information.

* The round rather that pill-shaped dual-LED flash can be clearly seen on the image. Also, it appears that the lens will indeed protrude from the chassis rather than being flush with the device.
* The circular True Tone flash first surfaced along with a plethora of various alleged iPhone 6 components highlighted yesterday by French blog NowhereElse.fr.
* The new iPhones should be unveiled at a media event reportedly scheduled for September 9.
* The 4.7 and 5.5-inch devices are widely expected to sport a redesigned and thinner enclosure and include an Apple-designed A8 chip (said to be clocked at 2GHz, or more, per core), a Sony-made 13-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization, three new sensors and more.
* Though both handsets are likely to be formally announced at the event, the bigger 5.5-inch variant may arrive later in the year as Apple and its suppliers solve purported production issues with the device.
