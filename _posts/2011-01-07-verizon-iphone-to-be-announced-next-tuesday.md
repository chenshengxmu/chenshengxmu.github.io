* Here it is folks. It appears I was wrong when I predicted there wouldn’t be a Verizon iPhone this year as many tech writers/bloggers are receiving a mysterious invitation to an event that’s going to happen on 1.11.11.
* It’s no surprise that we didn’t get invited but some high profile Apple bloggers were. MG Siegler of TechCrunch for example, got a personal invite. Siegler confirms that it is the first time Verizon sends him an invite directly. Other Apple-related experts claim they received a similar invitation…
* We’re not the only one not being invited. Gizmodo, who has a pretty good relationship with Verizon didn’t get the invite. That’s another clue.
* A January 11th announcement would work perfectly with the rumored launch of the Verizon iPhone on February 3rd.
* At this point, I’m so over all these Verizon iPhone rumors that I just hope these are true. Let’s get it over with already!
