* Apple CEO Tim Cook just sent an email to his employees to let them know that the company is planning a celebration in memory of Steve Jobs, who passed away last week.
* The event will take place at Apple’s HQ on Wednesday, October 19th, at 10am…
* Team,
* Like many of you, I have experienced the saddest days of my lifetime and shed many tears during the past week. But I’ve found some comfort in the extraordinary number of tributes and condolences from people all over the world who were touched by Steve and his genius. And I’ve found comfort in both telling and listening to stories about Steve.
* Although many of our hearts are still heavy, we are planning a celebration of his life for Apple employees to take time to remember the incredible things Steve achieved in his life and the many ways he made our world a better place. The celebration will be held on Wednesday, October 19, at 10am in the outdoor amphitheater on the Infinite Loop campus. We’ll have more details on AppleWeb closer to the date, including arrangements for employees outside of Cupertino.
* I look forward to seeing you there.
* Tim
* According to MacGeneration, who broke the news of this event, several informal ceremonies will be held at Apple’s location around the world.
