* The rumor mill has settled on two display sizes for Apple’s upcoming iPhone models, a 4.7-inch one and a massive phablet-class screen measuring 5.5 inches diagonally (for reference, the iPad mini is 7.9 inches).
* I’m dying to find out which model would be more popular with you guys so I put together this nice little non-scientific poll to gauge your form factor preference. This, of course, is assuming that screen size is the only hardware difference between the handsets, just like the iPad Air and the Retina iPad mini.
* Don’t be shy, jump past the fold and cast your vote now…
* For the record, we ran a similar poll back in January that offered multiple choices (4, 4.3, 4.7, 5, 5.5 and 6 inches) and only a little over seven percent of respondents voted for the 5.5-incher.
* That was before 4.7/5.5-inch sizes have emerged as most likely iPhone 6 candidates so that’s why this new poll asks you to consider only the aforementioned two screen sizes.
* Assuming the rumors are true, which iPhone 6 model would you buy, a 4.7 or 5.5-inch one? Here, cast your vote now and explain your thought process down in the comments.
* As a reminder, Apple is said to be releasing a 4.7-inch variant with screens built by Innolux, LG Display and Japan Display as early as September, barring any unforeseen circumstances.

* The 4.7-inch iPhone 6 should rock the same 1,136-by-640 pixel resolution screen as today’s iPhone 5/5s/5c, only larger. Should Apple make the display larger while keeping its resolution intact, pixel density will drop below the current 326ppi, but not below Apple’s 300ppi Retina requirement.
* And why would Apple do this? Because all of the existing apps would easily fill up the entire 4.7-inch screen without needing rewriting.
* The larger 5.5-inch model is said to arrive by year’s end or in early-2015 as suppliers are having issues producing thin batteries and display panels at this size. Screen resolution is believed to be 1 ,704-by-960 pixels – or one and a half times the resolution of the iPhone 5/5c/5s – so developers will need to optimize their apps.
