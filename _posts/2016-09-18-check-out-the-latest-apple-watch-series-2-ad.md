* In addition to a pair of iPhone 7 ads showcasing water resistance and all-new camera sensors that capture more light in low-light situations, Apple today also released on its YouTube channel a new commercial for the Apple Watch Series 2.
* Titled “Go Time,” the 60-second video takes us through the device’s major enhancements like a faster processor, built-in GPS, improved water resistance, swim tracking and more.

* Apple Watch Series 2 is designed for all the ways you like to move. With Built-in GPS, Water resistance up to 50 meters, and a super fast Dual-Core processor, it will inspire and motivate you every step, stretch, jump and pedal of the way.
