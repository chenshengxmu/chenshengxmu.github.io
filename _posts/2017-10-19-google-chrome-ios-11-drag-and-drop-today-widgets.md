* Google today updated its mobile Chrome browser for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch with a pair of new features. Chrome, a free download from App Store, now supports iOS 11’s new drag and drop capability on compatible iPad models and brings two new Today widgets.
* With support for iOS 11’s drag and drop, iPad owners can drag a URL from another app like Safari and drop it into Chrome’s Omnibox or the tab strip. This is useful when running another browser in side-by-side multitasking mode and you want to quickly open a webpage in Chrome.
* This feature works in reverse as well: you can drag a URL or a bookmark from Chrome’s content area and drop it into an app like Notes, another browser and so forth.

* As a bonus, Chrome for iOS version 62.0.3202.60 comes with a pair of new widgets for your Today screen. One of them, called “Chrome Quick Actions” and replacing the previous ”Chrome” widget, provides useful shortcuts to the commonly used Chrome features: New Search, Incognito Search, Voice Search and QR Code scanning.

* The other widget, titled “Chrome Suggested Sites” does just that.
* To enable the new widgets, pull down on any Home screen then swipe right to get to your Search screen. Scroll down to the bottom and tap Edit, then tap the plus sign next to the new Chrome widgets to add them to your Today screen.
* Tuesday, Google refreshed its mobile search app with support for drag and drop on iOS 11.
* Grab Chrome for iOS free of charge in App Store.
