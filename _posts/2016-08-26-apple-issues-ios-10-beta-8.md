* Apple today released an eighth beta of iOS 10 (build number “14A5346a”) to members of the Apple Developer Program and the seventh beta of iOS 10 to public beta testers who are signed on the Apple Beta Software Program. It’s worth repeating that iOS 10 beta 8 for developers and iOS 10 beta 7 for public beta testers contain the same features.
* The devices on a prior beta can be updated in Settings → General → Software Update, but some users are reporting issues trying to update to beta 8.
* Upon invoking iOS’s Software Update feature, some users see a prompt, saying “Unable to Check for Update. En error occurred while checking for a software update.”
* Developers can download the full iOS 10 beta 8 installer via Apple’s Dev Center. Speaking of new betas, Apple also released tvOS 10 beta 7 today.
* With public release of iOS 10 just a few weeks away, you shouldn’t expect any major feature changes or enhancements aside from bug fixes. And as we inch closer to a Golden Mater candidate, each new iOS 10 beta has become faster and more stable.
