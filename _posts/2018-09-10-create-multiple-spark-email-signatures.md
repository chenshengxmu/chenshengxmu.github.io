* If you use Spark as your preferred email application for iOS and Mac, you might use it for both work and personal communications. So, setting up multiple email signatures can save you time and ensure you’re signing your messages correctly.
* It’s easy to do and takes just a few minutes to create Spark email signatures and here’s how.
* On your iPhone or iPad, open Spark and then do the following:
* 1) Open the menu on the left.
* 2) Tap Settings.
* 3) Select Signatures.
* 4) Make sure the slider is enabled at the top for Use Email Signatures.
* The signatures you create will display on this screen. To add a new one, scroll down and tap Add Signature.

* 1) You can create a signature using plain text or HTML, so select the option you want.
* 2) Type in your signature.
* 3) When you finish, scroll down and tap Set as Default for… and select the email address that you want the signature to apply to as a default (if you have more than one).
* 4) Tap Save.

* You’ll then be taken back to the Signatures screen. To create another signature, tap Add Signature once more and follow the same process.
* You can also edit the signatures in the list by rearranging or deleting them. Tap Edit at the top to make either of these changes. Tap the arrow on the top left when you are done and you’ll be back on your Settings screen.
* On your Mac, open Spark and then follow these steps.
* 1) Click Spark from the menu.
* 2) Select Preferences.
* 3) Click Signatures in the pop-up window.
* 4) Make sure the box on the top left is checked for Enable Signatures.
* The signatures you create will display on this screen. To add a new one, click the plus sign on the bottom left.

* 1) The text editor will display on the right. You can use plain text or HTML, just like on iOS, by clicking the HTML button on the top right.
* 2) Type in your signature, use the text editing tools if you like, and optionally check the box to Always match my default message font.
* 3) When you finish, click the button next to Default for to select the email address that you want the signature to apply to as a default (if you have more than one). You can also check the box to have the signature apply to All Accounts.
* 4) Click Save.

* To create another signature, click the plus sign once more and follow the same process.
* You can also edit the signatures in the list by rearranging or deleting them. Select and drag signatures to change their order or select one and click the minus sign on the bottom left to delete it.
* Once you create signatures in Spark and select the account they should each apply to, every email you send from that account will automatically have the corresponding signature. So, you don’t have to pick a signature each time and you don’t have to type one in either. This saves time and lets you sign your messages consistently.
* Do you set up multiple signatures for your email accounts in Spark?
