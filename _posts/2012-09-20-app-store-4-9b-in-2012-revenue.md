* An interesting unintended consequence of a downgrade that is Apple Maps in iOS 6: people will grow to rely on transit apps and other third-party software to help get back some of the Google Maps functionality (until Google releases a widely rumored standalone iOS Google Maps app).
* And with Passbook debuting in iOS 6, we should increasingly download and use shopping programs (like the Target app) that produce Passbook-compatible coupons, invoices, loyalty points, tickets and other digital items.
* As a result of the new Passbook functionality and lacking Maps experience in iOS 6, cumulative App Store revenue for the calendar year 2012 could top nearly five billion dollars, a research firm has forecast…
* Note that Apple highlights all Passbook-enabled apps in a dedicated App Store section.
* Now, IHS iSuppli notes that the addition of the new Maps platform and Passbook app in iOS 6 has extended Apple’s reach into the real world.
* The App Store revenue will grow nearly 70 percent this year and is estimated to hit a whopping $4.9 billion, up from $2.9 billion last year.
* IHS analyst Ian Fogg says that iOS 6 puts Apple “into real-world location and financial-transaction features”.
* This means that nearly half of the revenue generated by the App Store in its five-year history will be earned this year alone. With this strong growth, Apple this year will command about a 65 percent share of the global application store market.
* He also thinks Apple has a far bigger agenda that anyone imagined.
* Apple is preparing to become not just a computer company or just a mobile hardware provider, it seeks to be a key company in all parts of consumers’ lives – from entertainment, communication and business that is now expanding into real-world transactions for travel, entertainment events, daily deals, and even retail.
* iOS 6 heralds just the start of this journey. And while Apple’s Maps solution may lag that of rivals initially, Apple still has all of the capabilities to win.
* In addition to iOS 6 automatically detecting digital coupons on web pages viewed in Safari and email messages handled by Mail, the updated Mountain Lion 10.8.2 software has built-in support for receiving and syncing Passbook passes via iCloud.

* Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the iPhone 5 keynote that the company now handles a cool 435 million iTunes accounts with credit cards enabled for one-click shopping (up from 225 million in June 2011), with over 400 million cumulative iOS device sales to date.
* Will you be using Passbook to get rid of paper receipts and handle digital coupons/tickets directly on your iPhone?
* I’m kinda looking forward to it, even at this early stage when just a handful of companies support Passbook in digital transactions.
