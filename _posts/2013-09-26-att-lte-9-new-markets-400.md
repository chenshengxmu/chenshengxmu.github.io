* AT&T iPhone and iPad customers will be happy to hear that the carrier has rolled out LTE to 9 brand new markets this week. The 4G tech allows for download speeds of up to 10x that of the average 3G network.
* Folks with an AT&T smartphone or other LTE-flavored device should notice substantially faster download speeds in the new markets, which include cities in Texas, Washington and Nevada. Full list after the fold…
* Here are the 9 new AT&T LTE markets:
* Earlier this month, AT&T’s total number of LTE markets crossed the 400 mark, and the network now covers 240 million people nationwide. That’s about 30 million people away from its end-of-year goal of 270 million.
* The carrier is rolling out its 4G network at a rapid pace, but it’s still well behind Verizon. VZW has been done with the majority of its LTE network for months, and AT&T is on track to finish up sometime late next year.
* AT&T does, however, enjoy claims of being the fastest LTE network in the US.
