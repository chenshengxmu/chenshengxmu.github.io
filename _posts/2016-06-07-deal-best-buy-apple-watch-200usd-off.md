* I wonder what kind of profits Best Buy is seeing with deep Apple Watch discounts, but here it goes: for a limited time, the electronics retailer is shaving up to $200 off certain Apple Watch models.
* The sale is offered on both the entry-level aluminum Apple Watch Sport and the mid-level stainless steel Apple Watch models. Additionally, certain third-party bands are currently available from Best Buy with a savings of anywhere from $4 to $30.
* All 38mm and 42mm stainless steel Apple Watch models are $50 off.
* The 42mm Apple Watch Sport model with Space Gray Aluminum Case and a Space Gray Sport Band is selling for $299 and the 38mm Apple Watch Sport with Rose Gold Aluminum Case and a Lavender Sport Band is going for $249.
* As for the 38mm and 42mm aluminum Apple Watch Sport models, these are currently available from Best Buy with up to a $200 discount, depending on the band.
* For instance, the $200 discount is available on the Apple Watch 42mm Stainless Steel Case with the Black Classic Buckle, meaning you can get it for $499 instead of the usual $699. The Apple Watch 42mm Stainless Steel Case with the Pearl Woven Nylon Band is $100 off, selling for $499 from the usual $599.
* Back in March, the Cupertino firm brought the Apple Watch Sport from its regular asking price of $349 down to $299—the first discount since its April 2014 debut.
* A Best Buy spokeswoman has confirmed that the Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch models that are $50 and $100 off, respectively, will be on sale through June 18. The models that are $200 off will remain on sale through June 25.
