title: Jailbreak App Adds Screen Brightness Controls to Your iPhone App Switcher

* App Switcher Brightness is a new jailbreak application – or rather a tweak – that adds a brightness slider to your iPhone app switcher. If you find yourself constantly changing the brightness of your iPhone screen, then App Switcher Brightness will most likely be a right fit for you.
* Instead of having to go to Settings > Brightness, you can simply double press the home button to launch the app switcher, flick to the right to have your iPod controls appear, and your brightness control is there…
* That’s all App Switcher Brightness does, and for $.99, I sure hope it works as advertised. This app does create a conflict with the App Switcher Volume app that we reviewed before. If you have this installed, you may want to stay away from App Switcher Brightness.
* You can get App Switcher Brightness from Cydia.
* Is that something you’d use?
