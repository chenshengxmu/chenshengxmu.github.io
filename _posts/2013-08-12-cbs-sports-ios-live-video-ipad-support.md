* Sports fans know about the excellent Sports iPhone app from the U.S. broadcast network CBS. Unfortunately, for far too long has this nice piece of software remained an iPhone/iPod touch-only affair, with no native support for iPad devices.
* In a ‘better late than never’ move, CBS has today issued a major version 6.0 update which for the first time brings the full tablet experience and live video to the iPad.
* This means you can now check out on-demand video highlights of past games or tune in to live sporting events from your iPad and AirPlay the show to your TV set through the Apple TV set-top box…
* From before, CBS Sports 6.0 includes schedules, standings, news articles, personalized Push Notifications (set up your favorite teams to be notified of scoring updates as they happen) and a bunch of highlights, such as scoreboards and real time stats for NFL, NCAA, MLB,NBA, NHL, PGA, Nascar, F1 and soccer (Premier League, MLS, Champions League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A, Europa League, Ligue 1, Scottish Premier, Dutch Eredivisie, Mexican Primera, Brazilian Serie A and Argentina Primera).
* You can also follow up to eight games on a single screen.
* Check out the iPad screenies.
