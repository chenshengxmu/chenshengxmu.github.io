* There is one big limitation to the changes you might have made to your display name in your Mail app. If you send an email to someone who has previously saved you as a contact on their device, then your emails will still show under whatever name they attached to your contact card.
* For example, if my wife changes her display name from Tina to Josephine, her emails will still show as coming from Tina on my device, because that is the name I use for her in my contacts. Makes sense, right?
* This limitation doesn’t happen if you are sending an email to someone who has not saved your contact info before though.
