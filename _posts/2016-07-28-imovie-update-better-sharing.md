* Apple on Thursday pushed out an update for the iOS version of iMovie, bringing the video editing software to version 2.2.3. The update features much-needed improvements to the sharing and project creation processes, as well as the usual batch of stability and performance improvements.
* Here are your full 2.2.3 release notes:
* – Start projects quickly by selecting multiple photos and videos – Share to Facebook and Vimeo using the standard iOS share interface – Support for Shared iPad in iOS 9.3 or later – Stability and performance improvements
* For those of you who have used iMovie for iOS, you know that creating a new project was a little more complicated than it needed to be. Today’s update helps streamline the process, allowing you to select your photos and videos up front, and then jump straight into the editing portion of the app .
* iMovie is available in the App Store, for both iPhone and iPad, for $5.
