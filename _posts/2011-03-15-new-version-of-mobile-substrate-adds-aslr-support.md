* If you’re one of the early birds who decided to jailbreak their iOS 4.3 firmware without proper Mobile Substrate support, we have good news for you.
* A patched version of Mobile Substrate is available that reportedly addresses the issues with ASLR.
* As you’re aware, the current version of Mobile Substrate doesn’t work with iOS 4.3, rendering many of our favorite jailbreak apps and tweaks inoperable on Apple’s latest firmware…
* Of course if you decided to jailbreak your iPhone with iOS 4.3, you had fair warning beforehand that such issues would occur. I’m pretty sure we’ll hear more about this directly from Saurik in the near future.
* This updated version of Mobile Substrate can be downloaded via your iPhone here, and opened and installed with iFile.
* I’ve yet to try it personally, but let me know what you find, and if it works like expected.
* Did it work for you?
