* As per the official release notes for the latest developer-only watchOS 4.1 beta that can be found on Apple’s Dev Center, the forthcoming software includes new capabilities like an all-new Radio app that supports cellular streaming on Series 3 models.
* Here’s an excerpt from release notes accompanying the download:
* With watchOS 4.1, you can stream music, giving you access to any song from Apple Music or your iCloud Music Library, straight from the wrist.
* The new Radio app also gives you access to Beats 1 live or any Apple Music radio station while away from your phone or Wi-Fi.
* And you can use Siri as your personal DJ. Just raise your wrist and ask Siri to play anything from Reggaeton hits to Top 40 tracks to French Garage Rock.
* Here’s our hands-on video walkthrough of watchOS 4.1 with the new Radio app and Apple Music streaming.
