title: CardSwitcher 2.0 now available on Cydia
---
* An exciting update to CardSwitcher has been issued on Cydia. If you remember our initial walkthough of the tweak, CardSwitcher is an alternative multitasking solution for iOS devices.
* This latest update was totally rewritten for iOS 5, and includes live application views, updated swipe gestures, and a new grid mode aimed at iPad users.
* Would you consider using the new and improved CardSwitcher? If so, you can find it on Cydia’s BigBoss repo for $1.99, but it’s a free update for existing customers.
