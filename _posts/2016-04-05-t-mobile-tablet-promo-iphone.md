* T-Mobile, a Deutsche Telekom-owned wireless carrier, today revived its tabled bundle offer with a cool new deal: you can get fifty percent off up to $200 on any iPad model if you purchase a new iPhone from the carrier on an installment plan. You must purchase both an iPhone and iPad from T-Mobile in order to qualify for this time-limited promotion.
* As mentioned, your iPhone purchase must be financed with T-Mobile’s Equipment Installment Plan. The rebate is provided on a prepaid MasterCard card up to eight weeks after your purchase.
* If you buy an iPhone on an installment plan, you can get a brand new sixteen-gigabyte 9.7-inch iPad Pro for $399, a cool $200 savings over its $599 starting price.
* In addition to “any new iPhone and iPad”, customers can buy another flagship phone like the Samsung Galaxy S6/S7 series on Equipment Installment Plans in order to get up to fifty percent off any tablet purchase, as long as it’s from the same brand.
* Both promotions are launching tomorrow, Wednesday, April 6, 2016, at T-Mobile stores, authorized dealers, 1-800-T-Mobile and through T-Mobile Care. And later in April, they will be available on T-Mobile.com.
* Moreover, the company is luring families with up to four lines with unlimited talk, text and data and up to ten gigabytes of LTE data each (no sharing) for $35 per line.

* Yet another limited-time offer from T-Mobile gets you half off any iPhone when you buy a second iPhone and add a line (the rebate is provided in the form of a prepaid MasterCard card).
* Earlier today, the carrier added sixteen new services to its Binge On and Music Freedom offerings. Just recently, T-Mobile scored big with the announcements that it’s added YouTube as a Binge On partner.
