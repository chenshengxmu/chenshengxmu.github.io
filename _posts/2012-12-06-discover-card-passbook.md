* Great news Discover cardholders, the credit card company pushed out an update to its iOS app today that includes support for Apple’s Passbook. Discover Mobile 4.10 allows Discover users to turn their Cashback Bonus rewards into eCertificates, which can then be transferred to the digital wallet…
* From there, the eCertificates can be used as a point-of-sale payment at participating merchants. So for instance, if you’re shopping at a retailer that has a way of scanning Passbook cards, you could be able to pay your bill with your Cashback Bonus reward points. That’s actually pretty convenient.
* Here’s some of Discover Mobile’s other features:
* Apple released Passbook, an app that aims to collect and organize all of your digital gift cards, coupons and event passes, to the public alongside iOS 6 back in September. And although initial adoption was slow, several companies now support the platform including Apple, Re/Max, Starbucks and Target.
* If you want to check out the new Discover Mobile app, you can download it from the App Store for free. Obviously, you’ll need to be a cardholder and a Discover.com member to use it.
