* Apple on Wednesday sent out press invitations for a keynote at its Worldwide Developers Conference, as first reported by Tech Insider. The keynote presentation is scheduled for the first day of WWDC 2016, Monday, June 13, at 10am.
* The annual event is where Apple previews its platform advances so we fully expect them to show the world what they have in store for iOS 10 and OS X 10.12, in addition to tvOS and watchOS 3 updates.
* Let’s not forget about Siri for Mac, a redesigned Apple Music, a Siri software development kit for developers to implement Siri functionality into their apps and possible rebranding of OS X as macOS, all of which should happen at WWDC, too.
* We may even see some hardware updates at the keynote, including refreshed AirPort wireless appliances, a long overdue Retina refresh for the four year old Thunderbolt Display and, of course, that rumored Echo-like device, powered by Siri and possibly embedded into a next-generation Apple TV.
* WWDC is set to take place from June 13 to June 17 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. The Bill Graham Civic Auditorium is a larger venue than San Francisco’s Moscone West, where WWDC conferences have taken place in years past.
* CEO Tim Cook has said during the iPhone SE event that the company expects to move in to its upcoming iSpaceship building early next year. The new campus has a massive underground auditorium where future keynotes and press presentations will be taking place as it’d let the company control its message in a tighter manner than before.
