* The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, an iOS version of the dungeon crawler game originally released back in 2014 by independent game studio Nicalis, is now available on iOS as a premium $14.99 download from App Store.
* Nicalis originally submitted its dungeon crawler for iPhone and iPad a year ago, but the game got rejected for depicting violence against children. The iOS port has a 17+ rating.
* In this game, you accompany Isaac on a quest to escape his mother.
* Along the way, you’ll find bizarre treasures that change Isaac’s form and give him super-human abilities to face off against droves of mysterious creatures. You’ll be discovering secrets and fighting more than 50 bosses, including many new and rare ones.

* Rebirth is the remake of the original game that now uses an optimized graphics engine which runs at a silky smooth sixty frames per second. The iOS edition also includes new pixel style artwork, polished visual effects, a new soundtrack from Ridiculon (Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans) and hundreds of new rooms, synergies and re-tuned enhancements by the series creator, Edmund McMillen.
* You’ll also love poop physics (I know, don’t start!), MFi controller support with analog directional movement and speed, two-player co-op characters, a bunch of Game Center achievements, mystic runes, upgradeable shops and much more.
* Here’s the original trailer for Rebirth from two years ago.
* And with over 500 hours of gameplay, four billion seeded runs, twenty challenge runs and 450+ items to discover, including 160 new unlockables, Rebirth clearly provides good value for your money.
* By the way, this randomly-generated action RPG shooter with heavy rogue-like elements was yanked from Nintendo’s 3DS eShop in 2012 for the same reason. Nintendo did change its mind later and published the game for its 3DS and Wii U consoles.

* Grab The Binding of Isaac: Rebirt for $14.99 from App Store.
