* As something of a calculator nut, I can never get enough of gorgeously designed calculator experiences. For most people, the stock Calculator is more than enough to run a quick calculation here and there.
* Apple, sadly, isn’t shipping its Calculator on iPads, forcing you to search the App Store for a third-party solution. But you don’t have to be a calculator nut or part with your cash to enjoy doing math on your Apple devices.
* That’s because developer Andrew J Clark of Very Tiny Machines has just slashed his beautifully done Numerical: Calculator Without Equal app from $2.99 to zero bucks.
* Download Numerical at no cost from the App Store.
* Numerical features a context aware percentage button so it’s ridiculously easy to work out a tip or a discount. The app’s heavy on gestures: just swipe to undo, redo and save the current calculation. You can even paste text from any app and Numerical will solve it!
* In addition to simple math, Numerical supports smart and automatic brackets, has a running history, works on both the iPhone and iPad and comes with nine user interface themes.

* With fast calculations, Numerical doesn’t need the equals button whatsoever because your results appears instantly as you type, with the current calculation always visible. And trust me, you’re going to love the automatic brackets feature that changes your brackets between open or closed during the calculation, automatically.
* All the features Numerical offers are available without restrictions, sans theming which requires a one-time $1.99 In-App Purchase. The app was released in February 2014.
* The screenshots below give you a good overview of iPad UI themes.
