* As Apple announced on its quarterly earnings call earlier this week, the App Store is now home to more than 650,00 apps. As you can imagine, this makes it tough for developers to come up with all-new ideas.
* But it also makes it tough for them to come up with all-new app titles as well. A new report is out today that takes a look at what the 25 most-used words in application titles are. Keep reading to see the list…
* The folks over at appsfire did the dirty work on this one. Not only did they find out what the 25 most-used words in iOS app titles are, but they also found out how many times each one is used.
* Here they are in order:
* 1. HD – 27777
* 2. Lite – 2160
* 3. Free – 18511
* 4. iPad – 11313
* 5. Pro – 9024
* 6. Guide – 8361
* 7. Mobile – 7695
* 8. App – 6142
* 9. iPhone – 5441
* 10. Game – 5377
* 11. Travel – 4851
* 12. Radio – 4633
* 13. World – 4504
* 14. Map – 4351

* 23. Photo – 2957
* 24. Puzzle – 2835
* 25. Music – 2764
* Honestly, there’s not many surprises here. You would think that ‘free’ would be the most-used word. But then again, HD is arguably one of the most popular marketing buzz words right now.
* While this stuff isn’t necessarily groundbreaking, it’s interesting to see which words developers are using to market their apps. Remember, titles are the first thing users see or read on an app.
* What do you think of the above list?
