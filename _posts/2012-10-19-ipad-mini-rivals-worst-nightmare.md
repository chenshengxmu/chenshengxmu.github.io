title: Smaller iPad may be competitions worst nightmare, analysts agree
---
* Analysts are almost busting their buttons to tell investors just how big a deal they expect is a smaller iPad, widely thought to be up for an introduction next Tuesday. One well-known Apple watcher foresees huge headaches from rival seven-inch tablet makers, describing the so-called iPad mini as “competition’s worst nightmare.”

* Shaw Wu of Sterne Agee writes the iPad mini will come on the scene as Apple’s competitors are already running hard just to keep up with the larger iPad 2.
* The Cupertino, Caliornia gadget designer may even phase-out the $399 iPad 2 in order to focus attention even more strongly on the leading brand. Add a 7.85-inch iPad mini expected to sell for under $300 – and rival tablet manufacturers lose both the size advantage as well as the lower price tag…
* Although Wu believes (via AppleInsider) Apple could “go for the kill” and sell the smaller iPad in the same $199 range as Amazon’s Kindle Fire HD or Google’s Nexus 7, the company doesn’t have to harm its palatial profit margin in order to overwhelm its rivals.
* Indeed, the analyst believes the smaller iPad could carry a $350 price tag – just shy of the $399 iPad 2 – and still have plenty of sales.
* A similar point was made earlier today by another analyst.
* Apple has leveraged its design and engineering expertise to turn a tidy profit during an otherwise down period of PC makers, Rob Cihra of Evercore Partners noted.
* Its control of both hardware and software allowed Apple to “pull dollars away from otherwise commodity markets and incumbent competitors”. The company, for instance, has reported a 30 percent increase in 2012 revenues compared to a four percent decrease for PC makers, the analyst told investors.

* Cihra believes Apple could phase-out the iPad 2 to offer “clearer product lines”.
* This would make sense given reports that the iPad mini will easily run apps designed for the iPad 2.
* By the way, if the somewhat reliable DigiTimes, an Asian trade publication, is to be believed, Google will roll out a $99 Nexus 7 tablet in time for Christmas.
* What’s your opinion?
* With the two leading selling points – size and price – largely coopted by Apple, how will rival tablet makers compete against a smaller iPad?
