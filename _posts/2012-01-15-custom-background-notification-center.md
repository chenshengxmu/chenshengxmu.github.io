* Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to add your own background image to iOS 5’s Notification Center? Well if your device is jailbroken, now you can.
* Introducing: Custom NC Background — a jailbreak tweak that allows you to add you own visual style to Notification Center by means of a snapshot from the Camera Roll…
* I have to be honest, when I first saw this tweak I thought that it would surely make Notification Center laggy and slow. I’m pleased to report that that’s not the case at all. Notification Center is just as smooth with a custom background as it is without one, as the tweak introduces no discernable lag.
* WinterBoard isn’t a prerequisite, so that’s a breath of fresh air for those of you who avoid it like the plague, and it even plays nice with IntelliScreenX.
* I didn’t think that a background photo would make much of a difference to Notification Center, but I really like the look, and I think you will too.
* If your iDevice is jailbroken, head over to Cydia where you can download Custom NC Background for free.
* What are your thoughts on this tweak?
