* Earlier this morning at 7:01am local time, Apple’s wrist-worn device went on sale in three new markets: New Zealand, Russia and Turkey. The Apple Watch is available through the Apple Online Store in New Zealand, Russia and Turkey, in addition to select non-Apple locations.
* In Turkey, for example, the device is also available via company-woned brick-and-mortar stores at the Zorlu Center and Akasya Shopping Center in Istanbul. In Russia, the Apple Watch is available for walk-in customers at iPort, Re:Store and C-store outlets. And in New Zealand, the Apple Watch can be purchased in select Apple Stores.
* Apple Watch prices in New Zealand, Turkey and Russia are as follows:
* New Zealand
* Russia
* Turkey
* The New Zealand Herald reports that the device debuted quietly in the country as the hype for the gizmo is noticeably more subdued than previous products.
* Here’s a customer checking out the watch at a New Zealand Apple Store.
