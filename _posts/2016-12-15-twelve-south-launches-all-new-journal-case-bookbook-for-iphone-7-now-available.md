* Want to give your new iPhone 7 that vintage look without sacrificing device protection? Look no further than BookBook, the family of stylish leather cases from premium accessory maker Twelve South. Starting today, their BookBook case is available for iPhone 7/Plus and they also have an all-new edition, called Journal. Billed as their most luxurious folio case, Journal uses full-grain leather on both the outside and inside for a clean look.
* Like BookBook, Journal features slots for cards, cash and ID. Both BookBook and Journal are now available for $59.99 and $69.99, respectively.
* Compared with BookBook cases for other iPhone models, BookBook for iPhone 7 features an upgraded card slot and wallet design to prevent stretching and pilling, has a redesigned spine design “to add variety to your library” and sports dark interior finish to better resist dirt and dust.

* Like other BookBooks, their iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus counterparts double as a hands-free stand that affixes your device in landscape orientation when you want to watch movies, enjoy your media and more. And thanks to a removable shell, you can protect your iPhone 7 even when it’s not in the case.
* This all-leather wallet case for iPhone uses full-grain, hardwearing leather for that premium, dashing good looks. “Even the composite shell that holds iPhone has a beautifully crafted leather inlay,” says Twelve South. The leather wrapped shell is bezeled to protect iPhone’s screen.
* Like BookBook, Journal has a built-in viewing stand for those situations when you want to watch some sports highlights, take a Skype call, watch movies and more. The folio can be even used to shield the sun when taking pictures or “for extra privacy from the prying eyes next to you on a flight.”
* BookBook for iPhone 7 is available in Black or Cognac color options, priced at $59.99. Journal Case for iPhone 7 costs $69.99, comes in Black or Cognac as well and is available on the Twelve South webstore.
