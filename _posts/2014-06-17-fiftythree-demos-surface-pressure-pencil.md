* Fans of the awesome Paper drawing app for the iPad by FiftyThree and owners of the startup’s companion Pencil stylus will no doubt be looking forward to upgrading to iOS 8 in order to take advantage of a new Surface Pressure feature coming to Pencil and Paper this Fall.
* Billed as an industry-first feature, Surface Pressure taps iOS 8’s variable touch sizing and leverages Pencil’s uniquely-designed tip to vary the pressure, thickness and width of lines you create, mimicking the behavior of real-life artistic drawing tools such as dry pastel chalks and charcoals…
* FiftyThree explains how Surface Pressure takes advantage of the Pencil’s tip and eraser:
* With Surface Pressure you’ll be able to control the lines you create based on how much of Pencil’s tip or eraser is in contact with your iPad.
* Use the point for fine details or the angled edge for broad strokes. Surface Pressure unlocks new capabilities for each of Paper’s tools — fill faster as you draw, shade as you sketch, or carve away in varying widths as you erase.
* Pencil is a smart accessory: not only does it pack in the eraser and the pressure-sensitive tip, it also does palm rejection, flip-to-erase and blend modes.
* Here’s the video.
* Again, Surface Pressure is coming to Pencil with the release of iOS 8 this Fall. The feature is unique to Pencil and FiftyThree has promised to unlock it for all existing users with a free software upgrade.
* The Pencil is currently limited to the United States and Canada, but FiftyThree is working on bringing the accessory to international customers.
