* Following the continued decline in popularity of Nintendo’s game consoles and portable gaming systems, the Japan-based game maker has been forced to make the tough financial decision of developing for smartphones and tablets despite never wanting to in the first place.
* Nintendo plans to have at least five mobile games available for such devices by March of 2017 as a part of its collaboration with DeNA, and now details regarding Nintendo’s intentions for a second mobile game have surfaced.
* Nintendo has revealed their second mobile game will include a “familiar character,” reports The Wall Street Journal. There are no clues as to who the character will be just yet, but it raises eyebrows because Nintendo is behind many of the long-standing video game classics, including Mario, Zelda, and Donkey Kong among others.
* Nintendo announced its first mobile game in collaboration with DeNA for smartphones and tablets at the end of October of last year, dubbed Miitomo, but it’s far less than anything anyone expected from Nintendo and it’s still not out yet. Miitomo will be a free-to-play game where users can customize their own Mii character and socialize with other users of the Miitomo game.
* “The second game won’t be another communication app, and we plan to adopt one of our characters that fans are very familiar with,” Nintendo CEO Tatsumi Kimishima said in a statement.
* Future releases from Nintendo are likely to cost money, and if they’re mobile games including classic characters from some of the most popular video games in history, chances are they probably won’t be very cheap either.
* Without a doubt, Nintendo fans have high hopes for the company’s future mobile game launches based off of the characters we know and love. Unfortunately, because Nintendo is strongly against emulators and porting games designed for a console experience to touch screen devices, those fans have a lot of void that may never be filled.
* Instead of remaking classics for mobile devices, Nintendo is more interested in creating completely new mobile games tailored around the touch screen experience that will feature the beloved fictional characters we know from the good old days.
* Which game character are you hoping to see featured in Nintendo’s next major mobile release? Share in the comments!
