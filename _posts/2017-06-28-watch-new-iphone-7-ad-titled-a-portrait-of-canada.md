* Apple’s YouTube channel was updated Wednesday with a new commercial in the company’s “Shot on iPhone” series. Titled “A Portrait of Canada”, it features words by Humble the Poet plus videos and depth-of-field photographs made possible by iPhone 7 Plus’s dual-lens camera.
* The photos and videos featured in the ad were snapped by photographer Caitlin Cronenberg and Canadians in locations across the country, ranging from Toronto to the Canadian Rockies.
* The ad, according to the description on Apple’s Canadian website, was meant to serve as “a portrait of Canada’s inclusive spirit shot on iPhone, brought to life by three Canadian artists as well as Canadians across the country.”
* And here it is.
* Song: “Suplex (feat. Northern Voice)” by A Tribe Called Red
* Canada turns 150 years old next week and Apple is joining the celebrations with a new “Unapologetically Canadian” page on the Canadian App Store.
* “Canadians may be famous for saying we’re sorry, but when it comes to building great apps, there’s no need to apologize,” reads the page’s description.
* “Canada is home to some of the world’s greatest talent, and we’re thrilled to celebrate these inspiring creators as part of Canada’s 150th birthday. Scroll down to explore the list of Canadians’ 150 most-downloaded apps and games of all time.”
