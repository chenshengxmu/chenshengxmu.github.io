* Apple this week inked a new TV series deal with ‘La La Land’ creator Damien Chazelle, reports Variety. The series will fall in the drama genre, and Chazelle will write and direct every episode, as well as serve as executive producer.
* Little else is known about the project, but considering Chazelle’s track record, this is considered a big get for Apple. The filmmaker is responsible for multiple award-winning movies, including ‘La La Land’ and the 2014 hit ‘Whiplash.’
* Today’s news is just the latest in a string of reports regarding Apple’s move into original content. The company is also producing a comedy series starring Kristen Wiig, a drama with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, and a reboot of Steven Spielberg’s ‘Amazing Stories.’
