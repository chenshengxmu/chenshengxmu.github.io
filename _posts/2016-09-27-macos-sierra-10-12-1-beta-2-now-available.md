* Apple on Tuesday seeded a second beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.1 to developers and public beta participants for testing, just six days after the first beta was made available.
* With macOS Sierra having made it into the hands of thousands of Mac users following its initial availability last week, Apple is already working on fixing things and adding new improvements.
* The macOS Sierra 10.12.1 update adds support for Portrait albums to the Photos app, a feature that will be in the hands of the public via iOS 10.1 very soon. No other major new features have been spotted in the update just yet.
* Small x.x.1 updates like this one are typical right after major releases to crunch stability issues that slip past the lengthy developer betas throughout the course of the summer.
* Developers who want to download the latest macOS Sierra beta can grab it from the Apple Developer Center or from the Updates tab in the Mac App Store.
