* Hulu for iOS was updated on App Store with personalized profiles for multiple-user accounts following the introduction of single-user profiles in December 2016.
* Personalized profiles for multiple users who share a single Hulu account are now available on the web at Hulu.com and in the mobile Hulu app for iOS and other platforms, TechCrunch reported yesterday.
* The oft-requested offline viewing feature will arrive “in a few months” as the company is working hard on the technology as well as on securing content rights, Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins told Adweek.
* When asked about it, Hopkins said:
* Yes, it’s definitely on our road map. It’s something that we’re going be doing in a few months. We’re working hard on the technology around that and getting the rights squared away.
* The refreshed iOS app now offers support for up to six personalized user profiles.
* That way, couples and families can finally keep their own watchlists, recommendations and histories based on their activity and interests.
* Restricted profiles for kids are supported as well. For safety reasons, kids profiles don’t provide access to mature content, recommendations, search, Watchlist and auto-resume functions.
* Due to licensing restrictions, only one user profile is allowed to stream at any given time. The new multiple-user profiles are now available to all Hulu users who have Hulu 4.10 or later installed on their iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.
* To learn more about Hulu profile, be sure to read this help document.
* Hulu has more than twelve million subscribers, but user adoption could accelerate as the company works to launch its own live TV streaming service in the days ahead.
* The service will be reportedly priced at under $40 per month.
* Grab Hulu for iOS for free from App Store.
