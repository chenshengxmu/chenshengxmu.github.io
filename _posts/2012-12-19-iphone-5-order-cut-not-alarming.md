* Quit your worrying. In short, that’s what one analyst Wednesday is telling nervous observers concerned over a report that Apple reduced orders for the iPhone 5 during the March quarter.
* Instead, the reduction in orders could signal a more efficient supply stream and greater profit for investors.
* As we reported earlier this week, Citi’s Glen Yeung kicked off the hand-wringing by downgrading Apple stock to ‘Neutral’ from ‘Buy’, citing increased competition and the lower iPhone 5 orders. Other Wall Street analysts piled on, cutting their price targets for shares of the iPhone maker. Now J P Morgan analyst Mark Moskowitz is the latest to say the reduced orders may not mean lower demand for the new Apple handset…
* Moskowitz believes (via Cnet) Apple is reducing orders for iPhone 5 components because its supply chain has caught up with an early shortage of devices. That shortage caused the company to press suppliers to up production.
* “Downshifting from ‘white hot’ order activity does not mean the world is ending,” the analyst said. Rather, what he terms “supply chain adjustments” could simply suggest “manufacturing yields on [the] iPhone 5 have improved, which means Apple’s gross margin profile could rebound to 40 percent, which would be a positive.”
* As such, the iPhone 5 “supply chain adjustments” are “explainable but not alarming”.
* Besides, the alarmist analyst notes came on the heels of Apple breaking sales records with 2 million iPhone 5 units purchased during the first three days the device was available in China.
* Not a sign of slowing demand.

* Rather, the report of a slowdown in orders to suppliers played into the prevailing theory that Apple was on the skids. I tend to categorize such talk with the Mayan Calendar hysteria and the overblown chatter that surrounded Y2K.
* Moskowitz also attempts to defang concerns that Apple’s competitors are on the verge of overwhelming the aging iPhone 5.
* “Overall, we continue to believe that Apple can deliver a 12-18 month upgrade cycle with the iPhone 5,” the J.P. Morgan analyst writes. “The new device is not a pocket hog or battery hog, relative to other competitive LTE-capable devices”.
* According to Moskowitz, LTE increased the  iPhone 5’s performance, differentiating it enough from the iPhone 4S to provide a “meaningful upgrade cycle” in 2013.
* Moskowitz expects Apple will sell 48 million iPhones this quarter and 45 million in March.
* Have you bought into the belief that all of Apple’s best years are behind it?
