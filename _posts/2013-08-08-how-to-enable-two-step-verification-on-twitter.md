* Earlier this week, Twitter updated its official app with a few new features. In addition to an improved image search and a better list maker, users can now get added security with two-step verification.
* Most of our readers probably already know how to use two-step verification because they will be damned if anyone is going to steal their identity and they will perform a fire dance if it means added password security. However, there are still new iPhone users that have not yet experienced identity theft, or just don’t know what two-step verification even is. For our readers who would like to know, we’ve got a quick tutorial…
* When you sign up for a Twitter account, even if you use a password creator like 1Password, you run the risk of it being hacked by some jokester who will post explicit images to your feed.
* In order to add a second layer of protection and make it harder for you to claim it wasn’t you who was “sexting” with your intern, Twitter has added two-step verification to its iOS app.
* Two-step verification is a security measure that makes you enter a second code, password, or other identification, in addition to your password, in order to access your account.

* Different companies use different systems. Twitter makes you verify your web based access using your iPhone and gives you a 12-digit backup code. So, if you want to log into your Twitter account on your desktop or laptop computer, you have to verify that it is really you by opening your app and confirming it.
* Here is how to enable two-step verification on Twitter for iOS:
* Step 1: Go to your profile page inside the app and tap the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear).
* Step 2: Tap the “Settings” tab.
* Step 3: Select the “Security” tab under the Accounts section.

* Step 4: Toggle the Login Verification switch to “On.”
* Step 5: Save the backup code that is generated in a safe place. If something happens to your phone, you can still log into Twitter by entering that code.
* Step 6: Go to Twitter on your desktop or laptop and log into your account.
* Step 7: When you see the login verification request message, go back to your app and select “Login Requests” under the Security tab in the Settings section.

* Step 8: Tap the check mark for the login request that you just made. If you see any login requests that are not yours, tap the “X” instead. This denies access to that login attempt.
* Now, your Twitter account is as safe as your money is in the bank. Just be careful what you tweet. You can’t get away with claiming that you’ve been hacked anymore.
