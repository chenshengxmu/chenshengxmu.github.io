title: How to stop your Mac from inserting a period when you double-press the Space bar

* Just like you can easily insert a period when you double-press the Space bar on your iPhone or iPad, this feature has now made its way to macOS Sierra. It seems to be disabled by default if you’re upgrading a Mac to macOS Sierra, but it was definitely enabled by default on my brand new MacBook Pro.
* While I find the feature helpful on iOS, it actually gets in the way of my typing habits on my Mac. For that reason, I have chosen to stop my Mac from adding a period at the press of a double-space.
* Like its iOS counterpart, this feature is tucked away in the Keyboard settings of your Mac. If like me you don’t want to insert a period when pressing the space bar twice, go to System Preferences > Keyboard, then select the Text tab.

* To the right of that window are several checkboxes for typing-related options. Simply uncheck the box labeled Add period with double-space and you’ll be good to go.
* Is that a feature you use on your Mac? What about on iOS?
