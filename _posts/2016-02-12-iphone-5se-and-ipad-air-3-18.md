* Apple is planning to launch the iPhone 5se and iPad Air 3 on Friday, March 18th, reports 9to5Mac. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the outlet claims the launch of the long-rumored 4-inch iPhone and third-gen iPad Air will follow their unveiling at an event on Tuesday, March 15th.
* If true, this would mark a departure from Apple’s usual launch cycle, in which products are introduced one to two weeks before they are available for sale to the public. Unsurprisingly, 9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman says that because of the quick turnaround, Apple is unlikely to offer pre-orders.
* Previous reports have suggested that the iPhone 5se will look a lot like the iPhone 5s, and feature the same A9 processor and camera system found in the iPhone 6. It’s also expected to have an NFC chip, with support for Apple Pay, and come in familiar gold, rose gold, silver and grey colorways.
* As for the iPad Air 3, it’s been described as a smaller iPad Pro, with similar features such as a Smart Connector, stereo speakers, and support for Apple’s Pencil stylus. Other rumors for the event include new Apple Watch accessories, such as new Sport band colors and Space Black Milanese Loop.
