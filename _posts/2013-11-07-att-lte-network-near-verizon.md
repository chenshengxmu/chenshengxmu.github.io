* Yesterday, AT&T announced that it has flipped the switch on its LTE network in 14 new markets this week. Places like Peoria, Illinois; Des Moines, Iowa; and St. Cloud, Minnesota now have access to the carrier’s 4G network.
* Obviously, if you’re an AT&T customer with an LTE-capable device in one of these areas, this was huge. But the even bigger news is that this latest rollout brings the total number of AT&T LTE markets to 461—39 shy of Verizon…
* GigaOM spotted the milestone:
* “AT&T announced another a new batch of 14 LTE market launches on Wednesday, which puts its total at 461 cities and towns in the U.S. and just 39 markets short of matching Verizon’s now-complete 500-city 4G footprint.
* AT&T first launched its LTE network in September of 2011, a good 9 months or so after Verizon’s 4G network went live. At the time, Big Red was already in 140+ cities with its LTE, and AT&T has been playing catchup ever since.

* The gap is closing though. Verizon completed its LTE rollout this summer, with its 4G tech in 500 markets covering nearly 300 million people. AT&T’s LTE is now in 461 markets, and hopes to finish the year covering 270 million people.
* AT&T hopes to finish its LTE network by summer of next year, where it will likely find itself behind once again. Verizon has already started building its next-gen LTE network, with recent tests in New York showing speeds of up to 80 Mbps.
* Apple launched its first LTE device, the third generation iPad, back in March of last year, and now all of its cellular-capable products support the tech.
