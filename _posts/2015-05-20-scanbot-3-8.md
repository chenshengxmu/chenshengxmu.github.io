* Scanbot, a freemium document scanner and QR reader for the iPhone and iPad, was bumped to version 3.8 this morning. The refreshed app adds several new features while overhauling the user interface on iPads, which now supports any orientation as well as collapsible document list.
* All users now get to enjoy direct uploading to Evernote with PDF, Images or Text option available through a reworked sharing interface, the ability to delete documents after upload and apply quick per-scan settings with a touch of their finger.
* Quick settings can be customized to include commonly used options like the auto-snap feature, optical character recognition (OCR), QR code detection, Camera Light and more.
* Moreover, there are now four different quality/size compression settings for PDFs. The app can now send your scans directly to Microsoft’s One Note software and export your scans to, or load images from, iCloud Photo Library.
* As for other enhancements, those who have unlocked all Scanbot features via a one-time $4.99 In-App Purchase upgrade will appreciate smart naming tokens for date and time and clipboard tag extraction, app protection with Touch ID, more accurate OCR and the ability to upload files via the secure FTP protocol (SFTP), the latter a major feature request from users who use Scanbot for work.
* If you’re in the market for a dedicated document scanner, consider Scanbot instead. Not only does it produce results comparable to dedicated scanners, but its unique document detection technology makes it much faster and more flexible than a dedicated scanner.
* Scnbot 3.8 changelog:
* For all users
* For Pro users
* Scanbot celebrated a major milestone today after reaching over two million users.
* “For many of our users it has become a daily tool to quickly and securely digitise any kind of paper,” developers told me in an email.
* “With the latest generation of Smartphone cameras in combination with Scanbot unique filters, the quality is comparable with expensive dedicated scanner hardware.”
* The 49.7-megabyte app requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8 or later.
* Grab Scanbot at no charge in the App Store.
