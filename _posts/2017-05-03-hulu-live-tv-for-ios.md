* Hulu’s long-expected live TV service has gone official with today’s launch of the Hulu Live TV app on App Store. Designed for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV, the software lets subscribers access the entire Hulu streaming library and more than 50 top live and on-demand channels, including FOX, ABC, NBC, CBS, ESPN, FX, NBCSN, FS1, History Channel and TNT.
* In addition, live sports from top pro and college leagues, as well as regional sports networks, are available in certain areas. As a bonus, you’ll get to stream national news with local feeds in select cities, popular kids shows, can’t-miss events and thousands of popular on-demand shows and movies from many of these channels.
* You can choose to subscribe to Hulu with ad-supported Live TV for $40, or an additional $4 per month to get rid of advertising. Advanced features are available for extra money, such as Cloud DVR which lets you record live TV to watch your favorites on your own time, the ability to watch concurrent streams on multiple devices, as well as track and record games from your favorite teams with a My Teams feature.
* Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube
* For an additional $15 per month, you can upgrade Cloud DVR functionality with up to 200 hours of cloud storage and the ability to fast-forward through commercials. Unlimited simultaneous viewing on as many screens as you want is an additional $15 per month. And if you purchase both add-ons, you’ll save a cool $10.
* As soon as you launch the app, you’re greeted with all-new onboarding experience.
* Firstly, you’re asked to log in with your Hulu subscription credentials. The app cannot be used unless you’re a subscriber. The setup procedure then takes you on a quick tour of the app’s main features such as your personal live TV lineup, a My Stuff section and more.

* Next, you can optionally tell the app about the kinds of shows you prefer to watch, helping it recommend content that’s tailored to your needs. Finally, you can add your favorite shows and movies to the My Stuff section, or skip this step and set up these items at a later stage.
* The app lets you create up to six personalized profiles so everyone in your household gets to enjoy their own personalized Hulu experience with their own collection of shows, movies, networks and more. Like with other services, the more you watch, the smarter the system gets.

* You can browse Hulu’s library while you watch with a Fliptray feature that lets you quickly find what else is on, change the channel, or get recommendations of what to watch next. Just tap the Fliptray button during playback to get started with this multitasking capability.

* A free seven-day trial of Hulu Live TV is available to new and eligible subscribers. As a cool bonus, Hulu will let you try out each of the add-ons for one month without being charged.
* Download Hulu Live TV from App Store.
