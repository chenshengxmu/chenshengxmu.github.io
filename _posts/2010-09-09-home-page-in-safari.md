* Home Page in Safari is a new jailbreak application that lets you set a home page in Mobile Safari, simply by tapping the ” + ” button while visiting the website of your choice, then tapping “set as home”.
* This is a very simple and convenient tweak that seems to be more useful on the iPad than it really is on the iPhone, as Mark from 9 to 5 Mac noted…
* Home Page in Safari is available from Cydia for $0.99. It is compatible with the iPhone, iPod Touch and the iPad.
* Have you tried it? How do you like it?
