* The folks over at ThinkGeek are known, at least in the iOS community, as the creators of the popular iCADE accessory. The gaming cabinet turns your iPad into a mini-arcade system and is compatible with hundreds of games.
* Now the team is looking to expand on its success with the new iCADE 8-Bitty game controller. Like the original iCADE, the wireless gamepad sports a familiar retro look and will work with a number of iOS devices and games…
* ThinkGeek posted the above image on its blog this morning, along with the following message:
* “We’ll cut right to the chase: this image is not photoshopped. Yes, it’s a handheld video game controller in the classic 8-bit style you know and love–but now it’s for your iPad or iPhone, no console or cartridges required. And it exists IRL (In Real Life).”
* The bad news is that the 8-Bitty isn’t for sale yet. ThinkGeek says that it plans to make the accessory available sometime later this year. But the good news is that it won’t cost you a fortune. You’ll be able to pick one up for a mere $24.99.
* This is by far one of the better wireless iOS game controllers we’ve seen in a while, both in price and awesomeness. If you’re interested in the iCADE 8-Bitty, you can sign up for ThinkGeek email updates to find out the moment it goes on sale.
* What do you think of the 8-Bitty?
