* It’s been an incredibly exciting week given the circumstances surrounding Electra1131. Now that we have a more current jailbreak tool at our disposal, we’re beginning to see increased activity from jailbreak tweak developers.
* In this piece, we’ll go over all the jailbreak tweaks released in Cydia from July 9th to July 15th. As usual, we’ll kick things off by showcasing our favorites and then outline the rest afterward.

* AutoPause11 is a simple jailbreak tweak intended for those that listen to music frequently.
* The tweak automatically pauses your music playback when you turn your volume all the way down, which can be incredibly useful when someone’s trying to talk to you in the middle of your jam.
* When installed, you’ll never have to miss a beat again.
* You can learn more about AutoPause11 in our full review.

* If you’re worried that someone might be trying to use your device when you aren’t looking, then CatchaThief may be able to help.
* This tweak takes a picture of the user with your handset’s front-facing camera whenever the passcode gets entered incorrectly. It then stores these files in your device’s filsystem for access later on.
* You can learn more about CatchaThief and why it’s a great tweak for catching dishonest people in our full review.

* MitsuhaXI is an incredible jailbreak tweak that brings a system-wide visualizer to iOS 11.
* When you install it, you’ll notice the visualizer inside of the stock Music app and inside of certain third-party music apps, including Spotify.
* The tweak also displays itself in certain Now Playing interfaces, such as those that appear on the Lock screen, in Notification Center, and in the Spotlight page.

* When you have an iPhone X, the Status Bar isn’t quite as informative as it would be on another one of Apple’s mobile devices. This is because the Status Bar needed some serious redesigning to work around the controversial ‘notch.’
* One of the problems this redesign brings into the light is the inability to discern when Do Not Disturb mode is turned on without launching Control Center. But a tweak called PurpleBar fixes this problem by turning the Status Bar text purple when it’s enabled.
* You can learn more about PurpleBar and how it works in our full review.
