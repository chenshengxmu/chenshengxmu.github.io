* Folks worried that the final episode of The Walking Dead: Season Two will be the end of the series can rest easy. Developer Telltale Games has confirmed this weekend that the story of the dead will live on in season 3.
* The studio made the announcement yesterday at Comic-Con, during a panel hosted by Skybound Entertainment. It publishes The Walking Dead comics, of which both the game and the popular television show are based…
* Here’s the tweet from Telltale:

* Telltale’s The Walking Dead doesn’t share characters or story lines with its TV counterpart, but it does feature an award-winning script and intuitive gameplay. You play as a main character, and determine your own fate.

* The game is split into seasons, broken down into 5 episodes. We are currently in season 2, which follows the story of Clementine, a young girl orphaned by the undead apocalypse. Episode 4 was just released last week.
* There’s no word on when season 3 is coming, but we imagine it’ll be sometime in early 2015. Coincidentally, AMC just announced it’s working on its own Walking Dead game, which is also expected to land early next year.
* Telltale’s The Walking Dead: Season Two is available on PCs, consoles and can be found in the App Store for $4.99. Each episode can be purchased via IAP for $4.99, or you can buy a multipack (episodes 2-5) for $14.99.
