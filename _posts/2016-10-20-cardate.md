title: CarDate replaces the Carrier name in your Status Bar with the date

* If you have an iPhone or a cellular-enabled iPad, then your Status Bar shows the name of your carrier so long as you have service. But is that really necessary? I mean, we all know what carrier we’re with.
* A new a free jailbreak tweak called CarDate lets you flexibly utilize this space in the Status Bar with the current date instead.
* By using this tweak, you can customize and configure any date format you want.
* You can include or exclude the year or day of the week, use dashes, periods, or slashes; basically whatever you want. I grew up using slashes to separate the date figures, so I typically like using the MM/dd/yyyy format.
* You can see how the differences in formatting make the tweak more or less minimalistic, depending on your personal tastes:

* To configure the date formatting you want to use, you can head over to Settings CarDate Advanced Options after installing the tweak:

* Here, you’ll find a text field where you can enter the date formatting you want.
* To format the date, you will need to know the following symbols:
* You do not want to put a lowercase “m,” because this will display the minutes of the time instead of the month.
* If you want to show the day of the week too, then you can use the E symbol. For example:
* EEEE, MMM d, yyyy = Wednesday, Oct 19, 2016
* Or, you can display the month and the year with the following format:
* MMMM yyyy = October 2016
* For more information on date-based formatting, the developer has an instructional web page you can look at as a cheat sheet.
* This tweak is useful in many ways because it’s something you can use as a live display of today’s date if you’re using a third-party Calendar app instead of the stock one. Moreover, you are able to utilize space that was otherwise just being wasted by carrier information.
* Before you say there are other tweaks already that let you have the date in the Status Bar, such as DateCarrier, I want to point out that most of them don’t let you customize the date format. You’re stuck with whatever the developer hard codes into the tweak. As a result, CarDate was requested on Reddit and a developer made it a reality, and it does a great job.
* I should also mention that CarDate only works on devices with active cellular signals and SIM cards, so if you try to use it on a device with the “No Service” or “No SIM” indicator, you won’t be able to see the date.
* If you want to try the tweak, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository in Cydia. All jailbroken iOS 9 iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads are supported.
