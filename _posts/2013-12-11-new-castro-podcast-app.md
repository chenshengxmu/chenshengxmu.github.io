* If you’ve been having trouble finding a podcast client that fits you, you may want to check out Castro. Castro is a beautiful new podcast app for your iPhone that backs up its good looks with powerful features.
* I should tell you up front that the app is for iOS 7 users only. You could tell it was designed specifically for the OS, as it’s rife with transparent backgrounds, flat UI elements, and a smart, gesture-based interface…
* Some of Castro’s more notable features:
* – Gesture-based interface that puts content front and center. – Episodes tab makes it easy to find the latest episodes of all your podcasts. – Full screen themes make podcasts look as good as they sound – Innovative player controls, optimised for podcast listening. – Takes advantage of iOS 7’s background features to keep your podcasts fully updated, even when you’re not in the app.  – Automatically downloads new episodes as they are published. – Instant, clear, notifications when new episodes come out. – Turn on News Mode to keep only the most recent episode of frequently updated podcasts. – Fast search. – Intelligent storage management — you set the size limit and Castro will delete old episodes as necessary to keep within it. – Supports streaming and offline playback. – Ability to play episodes without subscribing to the podcast. – 5 Playback Speeds.

* Typically, when you have an app that is very well designed, it usually comes at the sacrifice of features, and vice versa. But Castro has managed to find a nice balance of good design and a strong feature set.
* Now, I haven’t spent much time with the app, but I can say it’s worth looking at for folks who listen to podcasts and want to try something new. If you’re interested, you can find Castro in the App Store for $2.99.
* And once you’ve installed the app, be sure you’re subscribed to iDB’s Let’s Talk iOS podcast.
