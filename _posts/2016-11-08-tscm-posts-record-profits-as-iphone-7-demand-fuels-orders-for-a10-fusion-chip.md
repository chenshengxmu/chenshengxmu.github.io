* Chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) today posted record profits and its shares have climbed to their highest level on record as strong demand for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus fuels orders for the handsets’ in-housed designed A10 Fusion processor. That TSMC is the sole supplier of the A10 has no doubt helped it capture record profits amid a global slowdown in the smartphone market.
* Bloomberg reports that TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, now accounts for 16 percent of Taiwan’s entire equity market value.
* It’s “the biggest proportion according to data stretching back 13 years.”
* TSMC’s profit apparently rose 28 percent in the September quarter to $3.1 billion from a year earlier. The Taiwanese semiconductor maker has surged 32 percent in 2016 and now has a market capitalization of $156 billion.
* While the company has benefited from a broader rally in technology companies this year that’s seen rivals including Intel Corp. reach multi-year highs, TSMC is luring investors with record profit as demand for Apple Inc.’s new iPhones fuels orders for its processor chips.
* According to data compiled by Bloomberg, analysts are forecasting a thirty percent net income growth for TSMC this quarter. None of the 33 analysts who cover TSMC recommend selling the shares.
* Analysts are expecting TSMC’s stock to rise further now that the Note 7 is dead.
* “Samsung’s issues and the perceived benefit for Apple is surely creating some optimism,“ said Sandy Mehta, chief executive officer of Value Investment.
* “TSMC is the best in class. Valuations are not very high for TSMC, and rising estimates have led to investor optimism. The shares could still have upside.”
* TSMC is expected to build in-house designed AMOLED driver chips for the Tenth Anniversary iPhone in 2017 and was reported recently to have taped out an Apple-designed ‘A11’ chip that will power 2017 iPhones and iPads.
* The Bloomberg reports quotes TSMC as confirming that it’s almost ready to kick off mass-production of the A11 chips using its cutting-edge ten-nanometer process.
