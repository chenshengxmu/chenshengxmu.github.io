* Although it’s been losing ground to rival WhatsApp, which recently passed 600 million registered users, Viber very much remains the second-most popular instant messaging and VoIP solution on mobile.
* Following WhatsApp’s most recent half-baked update which brought out support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen but no iOS 8-specific features, Viber on Monday refreshed its iOS app for headline iOS 8 features.
* You now have Interactive Notifications for easy interactions with Viber alerts and a brand new Share extension making it easy to send content from other apps directly to Viber.
* Also new in this update: the unavoidable bug fixes, stability fixes and performance improvements, plus some design changes and other nice-to-haves to provide a more intuitive experience.
* Viber is available free of charge in the App Store.
* I guess that most of your friends migrated to WhatsApp, FaceTime and Skype, it’s worth mentioning that WhatsApp has nothing on Viber when it comes to advanced features. For instance, in addition to stickers and messaging, Viber also supports voice calls over Wi-Fi and 3G and video chatting.
* Facebook-owned WhatsApp originally promised to enable voice calling during the first half of 2014. However, they later changed their mind and last month announced delaying the release until 2015 for the team needs additional time to get the feature right.
* Viber 5.1 changelog
* The 54.5-megabyte app requires an iPhone with iOs 6.0 or later.
* Download Viber at no cost in the App Store.
