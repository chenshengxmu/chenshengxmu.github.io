* Apple continues to roll out its iPhone to regional carriers in the United States with the addition of Cricket Communications, a Leap Wireless company. What’s interesting about this particular announcement is that Cricket is a pre-paid carrier so basically they’ve just become the nation’s first wireless operator to offer the unlocked device with a pre-paid plan…
* According to a press release, come June 22 you can get an iPhone 4S or iPhone 4 without committing to a long-contract. Instead, you’ll be opting for Cricket’s $55 a month offering that includes unlimited  voice, text and data for smartphones. Of course there is fine print: data throttling starts once you go past 2.3GB.
* The luxury of not having to pay service fees for the next two years will cost you in hardware: the iPhone 4S is priced at $499.99 for the 16GB model and iPhone 4 will be available for $399.99. Note that this is a cool $150 cheaper compared to Apple’s asking prices for unlocked iPhones.

* Once you get a Cricket iPhone, you can take it on other networks as it’s not locked, which could be of interest to jailbreakers.
* Being pre-paid means you can cancel your service at any time, no questions asked (that’s why they sell you the hardware unsubsidized). If you won’t be using the service for a certain period – for example, while traveling abroad – you can temporarily stop paying for your monthly plan and continue whenever it suits you.
* Both the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 will be available in Cricket company-owned stores and select dealers in nearly 60 markets. You can register your interest online.
* To my knowledge, this is the first time Apple partnered with a pre-paid carrier to offer the iPhone – and at lower prices than its own stores.
* With the Cricket deal and the Pioner Wireless announcement earlier this month, the iPhone has now become available across fourteen carriers in the United States.
* Moreover, if Apple dropped the iPhone on a relatively small pre-paid carrier, perhaps the device will soon become available via Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile, both Sprint properties.
* I wonder how such an aggressive roll out across U.S. carriers affects iPhone sales going forward.
