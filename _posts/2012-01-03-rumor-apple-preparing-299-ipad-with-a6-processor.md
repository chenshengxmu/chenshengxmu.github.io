title: Rumor- Apple Preparing $299 iPad With A6 Processor
---
* Taiwanese publication Digitimes is reporting again today that Apple is planning two iPad models, with the low-end version starting at only $299. Both iPads will reportedly boast the new A6 processor and will be differentiated by their screen resolutions.
* Sources from Apple’s supply chain have claimed that there will be two versions of the new iPad, one targeting the high-end segment and the other the mid-range. Digitimes Research believe the two new iPad models will both be equipped the A6 processor with high-end model coming with a high resolution panel (2048×1536) and the mid-tier model featuring the same grade of panel as iPad 2 (1024×768).
* In my opinion, it makes more sense for Apple to drop the price of the current iPad 2 to $299 and introduce the next-generation model at $499. The idea of Apple releasing two new iPads at once seems a little ridiculous.
