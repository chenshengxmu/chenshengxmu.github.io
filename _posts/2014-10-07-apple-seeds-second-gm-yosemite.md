* Alongside beta 2 of iOS 8.1, Apple has today seeded Golden Master candidate 2.0 of OS X Yosemite. The update can be downloaded either through the Updates tab in the Mac App Store, or through Apple’s Mac Dev Center by registered developers.
* This marks the tenth and possibly final developer beta of Yosemite as Apple prepares to officially release the software to the public later this month. Introduced in June, OS X Yosemite brings about new UI design and several other improvements for Macs.
* Additionally, Apple has pushed out Public Beta 5 of Yosemite for its testing group. With today’s releases coming just a week after their predecessors, we don’t anticipate many changes, but we’re installing them now and will report any notable differences.
* If you discover anything new, please email us the details, and if possible screenshots at tips@idownloadblog.com. Or you can leave a comment regarding the change below!
