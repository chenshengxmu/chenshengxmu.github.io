* Apple today announced its plans for Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when all retailers will be hosting flash sales on many of their products. As usual, the deals aren’t as good as other major stores are offering, but they are worth mentioning.
* As part of its RED campaign for World AIDS Day, Apple will be giving away free gift cards with the purchase of select products on Friday. The cards can be used on apps, books and other iTunes content, and their values will depend on what you buy.
* Here are the products that qualify for the gift cards:
* And here are the gift card amounts per product:
* Again, not the best offerings here for those looking to save actual cash on these products—you’ll find much better prices at Walmart or Best Buy—but it’s nice to see Apple promoting the (RED) foundation, and its cause, in such a high profile fashion.
* In addition to the gift cards, Apple says it will be donating a portion of its Black Friday sales to the Global Fund.
