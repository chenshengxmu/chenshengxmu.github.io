* According to sources for Macotakara, Apple will unveil the iPad 3 in early February. The Japanese blog, which has a hit-and-miss track record, adds that the third iteration of the iPad will launch a month later, in early March.
* These claims reiterate an earlier report from Bloomberg, which also suspects that the iPad 3 will debut in February in time for a March launch…
* A previous rumor coming from the Japanese publication suggested that the iPad 3 is already in production, with manufacturer Foxconn responsible for 85% of the order and Pegatron supplying the remaining fifteen percent. Furthermore, the report claimed that the iPad 3 will have a slightly thicker design to account for Retina Display components.
* Rumors, rumors. It’s all we have so far.
