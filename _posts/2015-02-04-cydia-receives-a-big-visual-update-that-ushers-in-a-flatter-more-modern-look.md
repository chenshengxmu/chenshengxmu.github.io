* As promised by saurik, and as we reported on a few days ago, Cydia has received a modest visual update. The update, which makes the interface look a lot more modern and flat, has rolled out automatically, hence there is no need to download any updates.

* Is this update a response to iMods and Comex’s surprise involvement with that project? I don’t know if we’ll truly know the answer to that. But what I can say is that this update looks like it has been in the works for quite some time. Maybe its release was fast-tracked due to the news of Comex coming back to the scene, thus making iMods look like much more of a credible threat than it was previously, or maybe this was in the cards to begin with.
* At any rate, the update is a welcomed change, and hopefully just an additional step in a total UI overhaul that I think Cydia will benefit from. The underlying functionality of Cydia has remained the same, but what do you think about the upgraded optics? Do you like it? Sound off down below in the comments section.
