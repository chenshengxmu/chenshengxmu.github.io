* A new retail service by Apple, which offers to apply screen protectors on customers’ iPhones using dedicated in-store machines, is now available at Apple Stores in the United States and around the world, MacRumors reported.
* Based on Belkin’s ScreenCare+ Application System, the system allows store employees to apply Welkin-Branded screen protectors (either a Belkin TrueClear InvisiGlass Screen Protector or a Belkin TrueClear Anti-Glare Screen Protector) on the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus devices.
* Apple rolled out the system a week ago in its retail stores in Japan. As of this morning, the service is available across Apple Stores internationally.
* “Expert application of our screen protectors ensures an impeccable result that not only mirrors the look and feel of the native screen, but is so clear, and so precise, its hard to know its there at all,” Belkin writes.
* By letting an Apple Store employee use a dedicated machine to apply a screen protector on your device is the best way of ensuring it’s outfitted perfectly.
* Their InvisiGlass and Anti-Glare screen protectors are available in two formats, one tailored specifically to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s and a second designed for the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus.
* The $34.95 InvisiGlass is made from real flexible glass based on FluidFlex technology to give it the elasticity needed to absorb the shock of impact without breaking, while protecting the glass screen beneath. “Despite this added strength, the characteristics of glass remain to ensure it retains the smooth feel and glide of a naked screen,” as per Belkin.

* As for the $17.95 Anti-Glare screen protector, it’s made from a scratch-resistant PET material that enhances visibility by reducing glare from bright sunlight and artificial lighting. “Despite its hardwearing, protective capabilities, it is only 0.18mm thin, which preserves the sensitivity of the touchscreen beneath,” boasts the firm.
* According to Belkin’s FAQ document, a screen protector cannot be installed on a cracked or damaged iPhone screen. Should a customer dislike the screen protector application, a store employee will offer to reapply it at no additional charge.
