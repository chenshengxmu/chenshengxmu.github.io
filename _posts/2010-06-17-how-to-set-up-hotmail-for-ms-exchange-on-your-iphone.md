title: How to Set Up Hotmail for MS Exchange On Your iPhone
---
* Do you want to get Exchange ActiveSync for Hotmail on your iPhone? There’s not an app for that, but there  is a way to do it manually… Now I don’t know who in the world still uses Hotmail besides my Mom but I figured this info might be useful to someone, which is why I’m posting it.

* Setting up Exchange for Hotmail on your iPhone will allow you to keep your contacts, emails, and calendars wirelessly synced between your iPhone and the cloud.
* According to LiveSide, Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync support has not been officially launched but it does work for certain people.
* How to install Hotmail via MicroSoft Exchange on the iPhone:
* Step 1: On your iPhone, go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > and create a  new Micorsoft Exchange account.
* Step 2: Enter the following information:
* Email: youremail@hotmail.com Server address: m.hotmail.com SSL: enabled Username: youremail@hotmail.com Password: password Domain: <blank>
* Step 3: Go to your mail.app and you should see your new Hotmail Exchange account.
* As I said above, it doesn’t work for everyone. It didn’t work for me but it did work for a friend of mine. It’s kind of a hit or miss. The good news is that Microsoft said Hotmail will support Exchange later this year.
* Let us know if it works for you.
