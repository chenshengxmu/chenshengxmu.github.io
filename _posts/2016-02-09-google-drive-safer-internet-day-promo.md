* Google is celebrating the Safer Internet Day with various promotions and related announcements. The Gmail team, for instance, launched a feature that’ll warn users before sending and receiving emails from insecure addresses.
* The company’s Drive team has made an announcement of its own, offering two gigabytes of free additional cloud storage to those who complete a two-minute security checkup for their Google Account.
* To receive a permanent two-gigabyte bump in your Google Drive storage, visit the Security Checkup web tool and log in with your Google Account.
* Your account will be analyzed and the system will provide a checklist of actions you need to take in order for your Google Account to successfully pass the security test.
* For instance, you might be asked to provide a recovery email address, confirm your mobile phone number, confirm the list of connected devices or check out the list of apps and websites that have permission to access your account.
* Once you’re all done, and no matter if you completed a Security Checkup last year, you will receive a confirmation that 2GB of permanent storage will soon be added to your Google Account.
* To receive this offer, you must successfully complete the Security Checkup by February 11, 2016. The bonus storage does not apply to Google Apps for Work or Google Apps for Education accounts.
