* IntelliScreenX, the highly anticipated iOS 5 jailbreak app, is coming right along in its development, and the latest build features some exciting new features.
* To capitalize on Apple’s lack of any sort of quick reply or quick compose for messages, Intelliborn has baked their Messages+ app in directly with IntelliScreenX for a very robust messaging solution.
* Now you can quick reply, and/or quick compose from Notification Center, the Lock screen, and from banner message notifications. Check out the full video demonstration inside…
* As you can see, the Messages+ marriage is a perfect match for the already feature-filled IntelliScreenX. It seems to get better and better with every build.
* Intelliborn notes that they are still working hard on implementing more improvements and bug fixes. I know that they’ve delayed their targeted release date a bit, but if they keep adding features like these, it’s well worth the wait.
* The developers are targeting a Wednesday release date, and they are said to be working on biteSMS and iRealSMS support as well.
* Are you salivating yet?
