title: The AT&T/T-Mobile Merger Ain't Looking Good
---
* Besides Verizon, it looks like no one is in favor of the $39 billion AT&T/T-Mobile merger. According to AllThingsD‘s Ina Fried:
* You can add the chairman and staff of the Federal Communications Commission to the list of those who believe AT&T’s deal to acquire T-Mobile USA would hurt competition. […] FCC officials said on Tuesday that the agency found in its review not only that the deal would hurt competition, but also that it represents an unprecedented reduction in competition. In every market except Omaha (where T-Mobile does not offer service), the agency found that the merger would reduce competition to a meaningful degree.
* Obviously AT&T is not giving up and they’ll use every possible mean to have the deal go through. Some lawyer firms are about to make a lot of money!
