* Until Apple designs a physical keyboard for its tablet line, we will be subject to connecting via third-party cases. Finding one that fits both form and function can be difficult considering how many are on the market today.
* Logitech is tops when it comes to cases for the iPad Air 2 and the Type+ is both classy and functional. You can protect your tablet with style and use it for robust typing activities.
* Logitech is best known for their well-designed mobile keyboards and the Type+ is no exception. The concave keys are spaced apart comfortably for a familiar laptop-style experience. It features an entire row of iOS specific functions so you can access the Home screen, control media playback, and more. It has a specially designed folio style stand that holds your tablet in place so you can tap away without tipping over your device.
* The case is made from liquid-repellant fabric so you can spill wine on top of it without risk of ruining your iPad Air 2. The corner clips hold the iPad securely in place, but allow for quick removal of the device.
* The folio cover is designed to allow you to hold your iPad Air 2 in two positions, upright for typing and flat for touch-based activities.
* Logitechâ€™s Type+ protective keyboard case for iPad Air 2 comes in black and costs $80 on Amazon. There is also a green one available for $98 and a dark blue one for $78.
