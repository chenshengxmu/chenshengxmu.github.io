* While Apple’s Project Titan reportedly shifted gear and is currently focused on autonomous driving software rather than the actual car hardware, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the Cupertino technology giant doesn’t have some big plans in that space.
* According to the remarks from Apple’s Cook during the company’s earnings call with investors and analysts yesterday, they do have  “a large project going” in terms of autonomous systems.
* Here’s the full quote (emphasis mine):
* In terms of autonomous systems, what we’ve said it that we’re very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view. We do have a large project going, and we’re making a big investment in this.
* From our point of view, autonomy is sort of the mother of all AI projects. Autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one. There are many different areas of it. I don’t want to go any further with that.
* Earlier in the year, he called self-driving technology “incredibly exciting”.

* It’s widely believed that Apple’s autonomous driving efforts will eventually become a feature of CarPlay, an iOS-powered system that allows drivers to interact with Maps, Siri, Messages and other iOS services via a touchscreen built into the car’s dashboard.
