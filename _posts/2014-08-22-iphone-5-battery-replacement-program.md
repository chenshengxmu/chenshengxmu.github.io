* Apple initiated a new Battery Replacement Program on Friday, acknowledging a small percentage of iPhone 5 units may be having battery problems. According to Apple, affected “iPhone 5 devices may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently.” If you purchased an iPhone 5 between September 2012 and January 2013, and if you’re experiencing these symptoms, then you might be eligible for a free battery replacement.
* A specific page was added today to Apple’s website where iPhone 5 users can check their device’s serial number against the database of devices that are potentially affected. The program is opened to China and the US starting Friday, August 22, and will be available to other countries on August 29.
* If your device is eligible for the Battery Replacement Program, you will be able to get your battery replaced by either an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple Retail Store, completely free of charge.
* Check your eligibility now and let us know what your status is. Personally, as you can see on the screenshot above, I’m eligible although I never really noticed any specific battery problems.
