title: The next Galaxy smartphone may come with a bendable display
---
* Samsung is on track to launch its next flagship handset, the Galaxy S IV, in April 2013 and reportedly the device will come with a “breakthrough unbreakable screen”, as Reuters put it in today’s report. You’d be forgiven for dismissing this news nugget as a pipedream of sorts, but bear with me for a moment.
* We’ve been hearing that Samsung’s been looking to incorporate flexible display into next-generation smartphones and tablets for over a year now. Plus, the South Korean conglomerate certainly has demonstrated its willingness to explore uncharted territories. At CES 2011, Samsung’s mobile displays arm showed off a cool 4.5-inch flexible AMOLED display prototype based on electro activity polymer, seen above…
* Reuters has the story:
* Samsung Electronics, the world’s leading technology company by revenue, is likely accelerating the launch of its next-generation flagship Galaxy smartphone – which may come with a breakthrough unbreakable screen.
* Codenamed “Project J” after mobile division chief JK Shin, development of the new Galaxy S IV could be aimed for release by as early as April, according to analysts and tech blogs.
* Reuters quotes Stanford Bernstein analyst Mark Newman who speculates that “either the Galaxy S IV or S V will have unbreakable and even possibly flexible and foldable displays by 2014″.
* UBS analyst Nicolas Gaudois believes that Samsung’s “preparations for volume manufacturing of unbreakable plastic substrate displays continue”.
* The report goes on to note that a foldable display could be the phone’s biggest selling point, much like AMOLED technology serves as Samsung’s hardware differentiator for the current Galaxy lineup.

* The S IV is thought to incorporate a 13-megapixel camera (Apple, you reading this?) and a quad-core chip.
* More importantly, it’s gonna have even bigger display with higher pixel density than both the S III and the iPhone 5. At 441 pixels per inch, we’re probably talking a five-inch full HD 1080p screen here.
* That’s “a big improvement from the Galaxy S III’s 306 ppi and better than the iPhone 5’s 326 ppi”, the news gathering organization writes. Some phone vendors have already adopted 1080p screens on high-end devices, like HTC.
* Unfortunately, we have no idea whether or not Apple is working on a 1080p iPhone. Full HD, or 1080p, resolution maxes out at 1,920-by-1,080 pixels.
* If it means anything, DisplayMate’s Raymond Soneira thinks the 1080p smartphone display is primarily a marketing pitch rather than an experiential improvement.

* Why’s that?
* Because – and he knows these things inside out – the extra sharpness of a 1080p display is wasted as an average person “can’t resolve sharpness above 229 pixels per inch”.
* Those with the perfect 20/20 vision might be able to notice a slight difference between a 720p and 1080p smartphone display, Soneira added.
* I personally doubt such a display would make sense on a flagship device like the Galaxy S IV. Then again, people used to similarly diss so-called phablets until the Note started putting on solid numbers.
* This way or another, I think Samsung’s gonna eventually do a phone featuring a flexible display, but I don’t think it’s gonna be a mainstream product.
* To me, a flexible display on a smartphone doesn’t make much sense, but I could be entirely wrong. Here’s a nice Galaxy Skin concept depicting how a bendable display might look like on the Galaxy smartphone.

* So…
* How about an iPhone with an unbreakable screen?
