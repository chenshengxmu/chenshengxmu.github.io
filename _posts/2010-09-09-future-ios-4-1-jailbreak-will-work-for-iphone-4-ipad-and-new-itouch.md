* Yesterday we reported about the new exploit found by pod2g, and today, MuscleNerd confirmed that it will work with the iPhone 4, the iPad and the new iPod Touch.
* This bootrom exploit will require a hardware fix for Apple to prevent future jailbreaks. If you have an iPhone 4 now, that means you’d potentially be able to jailbreak it, no matter what iOS you install on it in the future. Of course at this point it’s just theories…
* The Dev Team is currently working on this new exploit and as I said yesterday, I wouldn’t be surprised if we got an iOS 4.1 jailbreak by the end of the month. There’s obviously a lot of work to be done, but the hardest job has been completed.
* Congrats to pod2g and all other iPhone hackers that spend so much time on this.
