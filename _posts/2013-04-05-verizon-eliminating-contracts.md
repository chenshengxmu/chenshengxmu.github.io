* As T-Mobile this morning started accepting pre-orders for the iPhone 5, its ‘Uncarrier’ initiative is about to be put to the real test. Will consumer prefer paying $20 in monthly installments for their iPhone 5 (with $99 downpayment) in exchange for a more affordable and simpler wireless service plan?
* Or, would they rather continue dropping a hundred bucks or more each month for their overpriced wireless service, with no easy way to cancel their long-term commitment without incurring hefty penalties and hidden fees?
* We should know in the coming days and weeks as the Deutsche Telekom-owned telco starts selling the popular smartphone beginning next Friday, April 12.
* When T-Mobile announced earlier this year it would kill subsidies and offer Apple’s handset on monthly installments, cowardly AT&T and Verizon employed waiting tactics, opting to instead sit on the sidelines and monitor how the situation unfolds rather than improve their own dealings with customers.
* When asked to comment on T-Mobile’s new Uncarrier business strategy, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam Wednesday rather ambiguously responded that his company isn’t really ready to kill subsidies right off the bat…
* Needles to say, Verizon is so customer-oriented that it’d at least be willing to reconsider its stance – but not unless its customers first demand such a U-turn.
* CNET has the full quote:
* McAdam said it was “pretty easy” to change up the model to eliminate contracts, and added that he would watch the consumer response that T-Mobile gets from its recent decision to drop contracts and phone subsidies altogether.
* He indicated a willingness to follow suit if consumers start asking for it.
* So go ahead and start “asking for it” in the hope that Verizon would abandon its exorbitant pricing schemes.
* He, of course, is very “happy when I see something different tried.”
* And yes, Verizon can react “quickly to consumers’ shifting needs.”

* He gave a similar lame comment back in January, telling Reuters that T-Mobile USA’s new strategy was “very intriguing,” but wondered if consumers are ready to pay full price.
* Our little non-scientific poll reveals that about half the respondents are willing to drop their carrier and go with T-Mobile’s Uncarrier.
* Verizon Wireless has the best 4G coverage and ranks highest in terms of voice and data service quality, according to both Consumer Reports and Rootmetrics.
* What’s your stance on Verizon ignoring what looks to be a new and modern wireless industry business model in the making?
