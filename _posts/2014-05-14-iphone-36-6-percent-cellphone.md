* According to a new report from Bloomberg, the iPhone now accounts for more than one-third of Japan’s mobile phone market. Citing data from MM Research Institute Ltd, the outlet says shipments for Apple’s smartphone jumped to 36.6% in the year-ended March.
* That’s a sizable jump from the previous year, where the iPhone held some 25% of the market, and it’s all thanks to NTT Docomo. Last September, Apple inked a deal with the company—which is the largest carrier in Japan—to finally start officially offering its handset…
* From Bloomberg’s report:
* Apple Inc. (AAPL) boosted its share of the Japan mobile-phone market to more than a third after the country’s largest wireless carrier started selling the iPhone.
* Apple boosted iPhone shipments in Japan to 36.6 percent of the market in the year ended March, up from 25.5 percent a year earlier, according to Tokyo-based MM Research Institute Ltd. The Cupertino, California-based smartphone maker shipped 14.43 million phones in Japan the past fiscal year, the researcher said.
* The numbers aren’t terribly surprising, given that the iPhone has always been fairly popular in Japan. During the October quarter of last year, Counterpoint Research reported that the iPhone 5s/5c outsold all other smartphones 3:1 in the country during the period.

* So how did Samsung and other competitors fair in the Japanese market during the past fiscal year? After Apple, Sharp came in second with 13% of the market, and Sony came in third, taking 12.3% with 4.84 million phones shipped. Samsung took the 6th spot, at 5.7%.
* Apple continues to grow its smartphone presence in Asia. In addition to the iPhone’s success in Japan, it’s also seen a recent jump in marketshare in China thanks to this year’s China Mobile deal. The company is expected to launch a new handset this fall with a larger display.
