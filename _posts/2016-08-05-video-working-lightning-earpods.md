* Apple’s official Lightning-based EarPods (that could be marketed under the ‘AirPods’ moniker, according to a trademark filing) were already filmed on video and depicted on leaked photos. Today, UK-based mobile accessory firm MobileFun posted a hands-on video of its own of what appears to be a wired, Lightning-based edition of the EarPods.
* Apple, as you know, is widely expected to ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack from its next iPhone in favor of Bluetooth wireless headsets and Lightning-based wired ones, the latter potentially providing lossless digital sound.
* Here’s a close up look at these working iPhone 7 earphones that feature the familiar Lightning connector instead of the traditional 3.5mm analog headphone connection.
* Accessory and case makers often post these types of things as a way to drum up publicity for their own business for free. That being said, however, the earphones shown on this video do look genuine, don’t you think?
* Let us know what you think in the comments.
