* You can take or import product photos, choose from multiple template options, share on WhatsApp and Facebook and send PDFs to customers. The app will re-size and arrange the images in the most beautiful way possible. Once you import images from the Camera roll, they’ll be available within the app to reuse.
* Sprightly’s high-quality pre-designed templates make it easier to create content on the fly without needing to start from scratch.
* Microsoft Garage, a skunkworks team that puts out experimental apps and projects, recently released the Hub Keyboard for iPhone.
* Sprightly requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 9.0 or later. There’s no watchOS 2 component in Sprightly. The app is localized in English, Catalan, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.
* Grab Sprightly for free on the App Store.
