* Apple seeded beta number 6 of iOS 5 to developers today. And while some folks are rushing out to download the new software, others are waiting for word on if and when it will be jailbroken.
* With previous iOS 5 releases, we’ve had to wait for the jailbreak community to update tools like RedSn0w and Sn0wBreeze to be compatible with the new firmware…
* Typically when Apple releases new firmware, we advise you to stay away from it until we can confirm it’s safe to jailbreak. This simply means that we want to make sure that updating to the new software won’t kill your current exploit.
* We can confirm that it is not safe for jailbreakers to update as there is currently no way to jailbreak iOS 5 beta 6.
* Any questions?
