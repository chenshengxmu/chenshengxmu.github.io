* Customers who don’t opt to pre-order an Apple Watch this Friday could run into inventory problems when trying to order the Apple Watch at launch. German-based Apple blog Macerkopf.de has discovered what looks like shipping dates for the wearable, which appeared on Apple’s German and U.K web stores, and some models show up to 6 week lead times for select models.
* The shipping estimates have since been removed, but Macerkopf was able to grab the times for each Apple Watch model, which we’ve posted below (via MacRumors):
* It’s worth noting that the publication says these estimates are “for the launch on 24 April,” suggesting that those that choose to pre-order the Apple Watch won’t see delayed shipping. And that makes sense, given that Apple usually sets aside inventory specifically for pre-orders. But that inventory will likely be limited, meaning those who don’t get in quickly may still see delays.
* The Apple Watch, originally announced in September of last year, will become available for pre-order on Friday morning. Embargoed reviews of the device began hitting the web today, with mixed ratings. Many websites praised it for its beautiful design and swath of features, but others panned it for its sluggish user interface and poor battery life. The Watch officially launches April 24.
