* Apple’s user manual entitled The iPhone User Guide for iOS 6 was released as a downloadable PDF document four days ago, but it wasn’t immediately available via the iBookstore. The 155-page document is meant to help new users get acquainted with the iPhone 5 and iOS 6. And now, it is available as a free e-book on the iBookstore so those that prefer electronic books optimized for iOS devices – as opposed to importing and reading PDFs in the iBooks app – are advised to download this handy guide…
* It surely beats the little booklet that came in the box.
* From iTunes release notes:
* Here’s everything you need to know about iPhone, in a handy eBook format. Get to know iPhone and discover all the amazing things it can do, and how to do them. It’s the definitive guide for getting the most from your new iPhone, straight from Apple. The iPhone User Guide is an essential part of any iPhone library.
* Here’s what an overview of Apple’s controversial new Maps app looks like.

* Interestingly enough, Apple is advising people to “defer to posted signs to resolve any discrepancies” because “data services are subject to change and may not be available in all areas, resulting in maps, directions, 3D, Flyover, or location-based information that may be unavailable”.
* Of course, the guide also focuses on educating users on the benefits of using Passbook to store their digital coupons, tickets, loyalty cards and what not.

* I like to keep Apple’s product guides handy on my mobile devices, especially if they are in ePub rather than PDF format.
* Doesn’t matter if you’re an expert or novice user, sometimes you may just need a bit of servicing information, perhaps some tip or that particular little-used feature you could swear exists somewhere.
* It’s a 14MB download and provided in industry-standard ePub format so it won’t take much storage space. Plus, you can consult this guide whenever needed, even without network connectivity.
* It’s definitely useful for the folks who are both new to the iPhone, but those who have been using the device for years and want to get the most out of it should also consult it from time to time.
* What are you waiting for?
* Get downloading!
