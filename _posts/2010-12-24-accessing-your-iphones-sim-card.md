* The presence of a SIM card slot is one of the things that differentiates the iPhone from your run of the mill iPod Touch. How do you access the SIM card inside, and why would you even need to replace the SIM card?
* One good reason for doing so is if you plan on traveling abroad. You can receive much cheaper rates by using a SIM card originating from the country you’re visiting. Of course, there are other valid reasons and additional points that you’ll want to keep in mind as well…
* If you ever want to unlock your iPhone, learning how to remove your SIM card is one of the first steps towards that goal. If you’re an iPhone 4 owner, and plan to use your phone on another carrier, chances are you’ll have to learn how to cut your SIM card as well.
