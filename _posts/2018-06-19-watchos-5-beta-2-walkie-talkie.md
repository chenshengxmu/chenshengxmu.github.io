* Today’s release of a second developer beta of Apple’s watchOS 5 operating system came with a fully functional Walkie-Talkie feature that was originally labeled as “coming soon” in beta 1.
* Like the real thing, this lets you communicate unidirectionally, with a tap of the wrist.
* Then, let go to listen.
* Billed as a “fun and easy way to quickly get in touch with friends and family,” this feature can be activated between any compatible Apple Watch users around the world over Wi-Fi or cellular.
* Curiously, Walkie-Talkie is not available in China, United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.
* Juli Clover of MacRumors first gave a nice walkthrough of the Walkie-Talkie feature.

* On first run, you’re presented with a list of people in your Contacts who own an Apple Watch. Choose a person from your Contacts that you’d like to invite to join.
* They will hear a beep on their wrist, even if their device is set to Silent, Do Not Disturb or Theater Mode. Your friend will then need to approve a connection by tapping Always Allow.
* Once approved, both of you can start using this feature. The Walkie-Talkie app can even manage multiple conversations, allowing you to simply select a conversation from the list to continue talking. To adjust the Walkie-Talkie conversation volume independently of your system sounds, turn the Digital Crown whilst inside the app.
* A yellow icon at the top of the display indicates an active Walkie-Talkie conversation.

* Wanna temporarily mute an ongoing conversation?
* Slide the Available toggle at the top of the Walkie-Talkie app to the OFF position. Doing so will yield a message when someone tries to reach you using the service, saying you’re unavailable.
* Conversely, if they try to reach you while you’re unavailable, you’ll receive an interactive notification with the option to become available and immediately resume talking to the friend.
* Other changes were discovered in beta 2.
* Having combed through a second developer-only beta of iOS 12, for instance, Brazilian developer Guilherme Rambo uncovered potential evidence of upcoming hardware releases in form of hidden references to a plethora of unreleased Apple Watch models.
* What are your first impressions of the Walkie-Talkie feature?
* Let us know in the comments!
