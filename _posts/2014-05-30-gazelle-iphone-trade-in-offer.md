* Folks with an old iPhone laying around may be interested to know that electronic buy-back service Gazelle is offering extra money for Apple’s handsets right now. In an effort to increase its inventory, the site says it will give you an additional $10 on your iPhone trade-ins.
* For those unfamiliar with Gazelle, it’s an online storefront that will pay you money for virtually any used electronic depending on the make, model and condition it’s in. The transaction is done via mail, so essentially you send them your device, and they send you cash…
* How much they send you depends on the model of your device and its condition, and prices can fluctuate from time to time. At the moment, Gazelle is offering anywhere from $10 for a broken 8GB iPhone 4, all the way up to $360 for a 64GB for a 64GB 5s in perfect shape.

* True, you could probably get more for your device if you sell it yourself through eBay or Craigslist, but what Gazelle and the dozens of other services (including Apple) offer is convenience. You just drop your iPhone in an envelope, mail it off, and wait for the money to roll in.
