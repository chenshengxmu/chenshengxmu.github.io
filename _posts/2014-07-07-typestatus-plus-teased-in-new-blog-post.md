* Hashbang productions, the team that brought my idea of TypeStatus to reality, has teased an incoming new version of its popular jailbreak tweak called TypeStatus Plus.
* Why the Plus? For starters, it works with more than just iMessage. It works with WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype, and Kik. It also features Notification Center integration and Lock screen integration.
* How about customizable status bar notifications? That’s there too. What about Pebble watch support? Yep, you’ll find that in TypeStatus Plus as well…

* Needless to say, TypeStatus Plus looks to be very worthy of its “plus” designation. It appears to be a well thought-out and feature packed upgrade over the original TypeStatus.
* TypeStatus Plus is currently in a closed beta period, and unfortunately, the team isn’t taking on any additional beta testers. But don’t fret, because from the looks of things, the project seems to be shaping up for a public release in the very near future.
* As a side note, the free version of TypeStatus will be receiving some updates as well. Version 1.3 is currently in the works, and contains large portions of rewritten code.
* What do you think about these surprise revelations? Are you excited about the idea of having such a major TypeStatus upgrade? Sound off down below in the comments, and stay-tuned for our hands on walkthrough.
