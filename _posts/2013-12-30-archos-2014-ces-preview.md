* Ahead of the looming 2014 Consumer Electronics Show, the French consumer electronics company Archos is previewing an upcoming line of devices and accessories, including ‘Connected Self’ smartwatches and health trackers and various ‘Connected Home’ appliances, all designed to be compatible with Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android mobile operating systems.
* There will also be a Connected Self mobile application to “serve as the backbone application for all connected self devices” allowing folks to track their activity, check their health-related data, turn on the lights, automatically capture video when motion sensors are triggered and lots more. The full breakdown is right past the jump…
* A Smart Home Tablet, pictured above, is a seven-inch Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean device with a 1,024-by-600 pixel screen. It may not sound to you like something to write home about: it’s powered by a dual-core 1.2GHz processor with 512MB of RAM and has eight gigabytes of expandable storage memory.
* I’ll be keeping my eye on an upcoming line of Archos smartwatches, some of which will be priced at just fifty bucks and have a “Pebble-like design,” the company’s press release teased. All smartwatches tap power-sipping Bluetooth Low Energy (aka Bluetooth Smart or Bluetooth 4.0) technology and are compatible with iOS and Android.
* An excerpt from the media release:
* Archos connected objects are compatible with both Android and iOS platforms, provide real time information monitoring from anywhere and utilise Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity to ensure extended use without the need of recharging. Completely wireless and easy to pair, Archos connected objects are miniaturised and styled to blend into your home environment.
* As for the Archos Connected Self app, it’ll support all upcoming devices and provide key metrics for quick health assessment and activity graphs while enabling up to eight different users to set goals to increase motivation.
* Other gadgets in the pipeline: a weather station, home camera, activity tracker, scale, blood pressure monitor and tablet, to name a few.
* The Archos Activity Tracker monitors the usual stuff – including steps taken and calories burned – and claims a battery life of up to seven days. As a bonus, it’ll “automatically display time when synchronised with a smartphone” – wait, shouldn’t the clock work out-of-the-box, without the need for a companion device?

* Anyway, on to the Archos Connected Scale, another connected device that will dutifully measure your body shape based on mass and height and track your body fat mass. Your readings will get stored in onboard memory to prevent data loss between synchronizations.
* The scale will recognize up to four users.
* The Archos Blood Pressure Monitor was designed to display your heart beat information and take as much as 40 different readings. It comes with irregular heart beat detector and can filter data by time period (morning, day and night), the company noted.
* The personal Archos Weather Station.

* The upcoming connected-home devices include a mini camera “the size of a pin pong ball”, motion ball, movement tag, weather tag and smart plug.
* Finally, the Archos Smart Home app for iOS will enable customers to bring all these home gadgets together, allowing them to customize actions based on different scenarios or triggers such as turning on the light and recording video as soon as a motion sensor is activated.
* For additional insight into the upcoming products, check out the Archos website.
* CES 2014 is scheduled to run from January 7 through January 10, 2014 in Las Vegas, Nevada and iDownloadBlog will be providing detailed coverage of announcements of interest to the Apple community.
