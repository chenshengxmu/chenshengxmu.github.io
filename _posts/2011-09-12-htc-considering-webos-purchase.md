* You might not know it, but HTC (High Tech Computer) has been around for more than a decade. In its earlier years, the company produced smartphones sporting older versions of Windows Mobile OS.
* With the rise of Android in 2009, HTC started to focus on the up-and-coming OS. The move has helped grow the company exponentially over the last few years. In 2010, it also joined in on the Windows Phone 7 party.
* But the landscape has changed in the mobile OS industry over the last several months. Microsoft and Nokia have announced a strategic partnership, and then there was Google’s Motorola purchase. So where does that leave HTC?
* With both Microsoft and Google in bed with handset manufacturers, HTC seems to be feeling a bit left out. As a result, AppleInsider is reporting that the Taiwanese company is looking to purchase its own mobile operating system.
* In particular, chairwoman Cher Wang mentioned that HTC has been considering purchasing webOS from Hewlett-Packard. The operating system was the focus of HP’s Palm acquisition last year, and it has surprisingly been recently discontinued.
* HTC’s interest in webOS comes hot on the hills of a recent forced-licensing deal with Microsoft. The company is rumored to be paying the software giant $5 per handset for the use of Microsoft’s patented inventions found in Google’s Android OS.
* Perhaps just as interesting is that Samsung also happens to be in the market for a mobile operating system. With constant run-ins with Apple’s lawyers over patent-infringing Android features, the Korean company could also benefit from a new, proprietary OS.
* Lawsuits aside, manufacturers have obviously taken notice of Apple’s success with end-to-end control over hardware and software, and they are trying to emulate it. Microsoft with Nokia, Google with Motorola, and now possibly HTC with webOS.
* But Apple’s been doing this for nearly 40 years, do you think any of these teams stand a chance? Tell us why or why not in the comments below.
