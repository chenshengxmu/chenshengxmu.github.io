* In honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, Apple has begun highlighting apps with specialized accessibility features. The curated section features apps such as Instapaper, which offers text-to-speech, and Workflow, which can automate complex tasks, and is featured on the front page of the App Store.
* Apple has long been praised for the accessibility features in iOS. Grammy Award-winning artist, who has been blind for most of his life, famously took time out of a concert to thank Steve Jobs and company for their work, saying “there’s nothing on the iPhone or the iPad that you can do, that I can’t do.”
* Here are 10 apps highlighted in the new section:
* Instapaper – free
* Workflow – $2.99
* Transit App – free
* Overcast – free
* DanKam: Colorblind Fix – $2.99
* BlindSquare – $29.99
* TruLink Hearing Control – free
* ASL Dictionary – $4.99
* djay 2 for iPhone – $2.99
* TapTapSee – free
* Global Accessibility AwarenessDay began in 2012, and takes place every year on the third Thursday in May. The purpose of the day is to get people talking, thinking and learning about digital accessibility features and how users with different disabilities can benefit from them.
