* The iPhone 6 screen has a certain smoothness that is hard to replicate and is easily ruined by a basic screen protector. However, some of us are more worried about diminishing the resale value of our iPhones with scratches. So, a screen protector is a must-have for us.
* JETech makes a tempered glass screen protector for the iPhone 6 that offers protection from scratches and is smooth like the iPhone 6’s screen for a more natural feel.
* The glass protector has a cutout for the front facing camera and the receiver, as well as the proximity sensor and the Home button. It measures .33mm thick.
* Because of the rounded edges of the iPhone 6, this screen protector does not cover edge-to-edge. However, I still haven’t seen a tempered glass screen protector that does cover edge-to-edge and actually works well.
* The glass is 9H rated for tough scratch resistance. It has an HD quality clarity with fingerprint and halo effect resistant coating. The company claims this protector works with the new iPhone 6s. However, we still don’t know for sure whether tempered glass has a negative affect on the 3D Touch feature.
* The package comes with a cleaning sticker, which is used to remove any dust or lint from your iPhone 6 screen. There is also a small microfiber cloth and an alcoholic wipe to clean your screen before installing the protector.
* JETech’s tempered glass screen protector is available on Amazon for $7. There is also a two-pack for $9 and a three-pack for $11.
