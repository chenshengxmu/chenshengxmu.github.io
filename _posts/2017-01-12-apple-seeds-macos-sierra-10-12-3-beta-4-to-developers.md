* Apple on Thursday seeded a fourth beta of what would become the third major software update to macOS Sierra since its public launch last fall. macOS Sierra 10.12.3 beta 4 (build 16D30a) is now available on Mac computers that have a prior Sierra beta installed via the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store’s Updates tab.
* What we do know for a fact is that this update fixes a Safari bug which caused the widely reported battery life issues during Consumer Reports’ MacBook Pro testing.
* The magazine has promised to update its original review of the new MacBook Pro once it’s done re-testing the machine with the stable version of macOS Sierra 10.12.3.
* Release notes mention no new features in macOS Sierra 10.12.3 beyond improving the stability, compatibility and security of your Mac, but we’ll make sure to update this post with any user-facing new features in the new beta as they’re discovered.
* The latest macOS Sierra 10.12.3 build is also available via Apple’s Developer Center.
