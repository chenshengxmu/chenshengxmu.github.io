* Skeptical about trying to create your own Nano SIM without a SIM cutter? Would you like a more structured way of creating a Nano SIM from a larger SIM spec?
* The folks over at YoYoBase claim to have the solution, with one of the first available iPhone 5 SIM card cutters.
* The SIM cutter promises to be able to cut any GSM SIM card, which means it should handle both Micro SIM cards, and regular SIM cards as well.
* I have to admit though, I am skeptical, since Nano SIMs are reportedly 15% thinner. How is the cutter going to go about shaving a regular or Micro SIM card? Unfortunately, the product page doesn’t actually touch on how this is accomplished.
* The good news, though, is that at least the site appears to acknowledge this 15% difference in the product shots (see image below), so I’m guessing that the device goes about shaving off the extra 15% using some method. Sadly, since I’m not great with Chinese characters, it’s hard to discern how this is accomplished.

* A single until will set you back $23.99, so it’s not exactly cheap, but it will save you from having to perform surgery yourself.
* What do you think? Do you think it’s worth it to have a Nano SIM cutter on hand?
* Thanks to UnlockBoot for the tip.
