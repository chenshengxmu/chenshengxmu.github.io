* After launching a support account on Twitter in March of this year, which was a great move, the Apple Support team has now created a YouTube channel dedicated to iOS tips and tricks, how-tos and other highly polished video tutorials.
* “Tips, tricks and how-tos—straight from Apple,” read’s the channel’s description.
* At post time, the Apple Support channel hosted ten videos, some of which were previously published on their Twitter account as native Twitter videos.
* Here’s one example to give you a feel for high production value of Apple’s video tutorials.
* Apple also links appropriate support articles on its website in video descriptions.
