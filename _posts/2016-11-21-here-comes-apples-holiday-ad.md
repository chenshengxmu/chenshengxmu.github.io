* Apple just aired a brand new holiday-themed television commercial through its channel on YouTube. Titled “Frankie’s Holiday,” the cinematic video runs two minutes long and depicts an unexpected holiday visitor who finally receives the “warm welcome he’s always yearned for.” The unexpected visitor is Frankenstein himself, who happens to be an iPhone 7 user.
* The Christmas-themed upbeat commercial conveniently closes with a positive message which invites users to open their hearts to everyone.
* In the video, Frankenstein can be seen taking advantage of Apple’s Voice Memos app which he uses to record a small music box.
* And here’s the commercial.
* How do you like Apple’s new holiday ad?
