* Apple today pushed a second beta of macOS Sierra following the original developer-only preview of the desktop operating system that was made available following the June 13 WWDC keynote. Members of the Apple Developer Program can install macOS Sierra beta 2 (build number “16A239j”) on their computers running a prior beta through the Software Update mechanism.
* We’ll be updating this article with any changes discovered in macOS Sierra beta 2 as we encounter them.
* Apple today released the following OS-related updates for developers:
* In addition to rebranding OS X as macOS, the upcoming software update brings a bunch new features to the Mac, including deeper integration with iOS and expanded Continuity features.
* For starters, Siri is now available on the Mac to help you do the things you do every day on your desktop using the power of your voice. Expanded integration with iCloud makes your Mac’s Desktop and Documents folder available on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch via iCloud Drive.
* Universal Clipboard works between iOS and macOS, allowing you to copy text, images, photos and video from one Apple device and paste it in another. Sierra also includes Safari 10 with support for Picture-in-Picture, native App Extensions and Apple Pay on websites.
* Like iOS 10, macOS Sierra packs in an enhanced Photos app with a new Memories feature that uses advanced facial and objet recognition, and more.
* macOS Sierra is available as a developer-only preview to all members of the Apple Developer Program. The operating system will be available to public beta testers via the Apple Beta Software Program in July ahead of its general availability this fall.
* macOS Sierra will support a smaller number of Macs than previous editions. Supported computer models include late-2009 and later MacBooks and iMacs, and 2010-and-later MacBook Airs, MacBook Pros, Mac Minis and Mac Pros.
* Macs manufactured before 2008 won’t be supported.
* If you spot new features and other changes in macOS Sierra beta 2, let us know in the comments and we’ll update the article accordingly.
