* Following the release of OS X 10.9.3, iTunes 11.2 and the subsequent iTunes 11.2.1 update (which fixed the disappearing Users folder in OS X 10.9.3), Apple on Wednesday issued a pair of Safari updates for OS X Lion, Mountain Lion and Mavericks systems.
* Both Safari 7.0.4 for OS X Mavericks 10.9.3 and Safari 6.1.4 for OS X Lion 10.7.5, OS X Lion Server 10.7.5 and OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5 are now available with fixes for vulnerabilities found in WebKit, the browser’s open-sourced rendering engine…
* Apple’s support document outlines the nature of the WebKit flaw plaguing Safari, which could be exploited by hackers to allow a maliciously crafted website to produce an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
* The Safari updates also fix another issue in the browser’s handling of unicode characters in URLs that could let malicious websites send messages to a connected frame or window “in a way that might circumvent the receiver’s origin check”.
* It’s worth mentioning again that Apple protects your own security by not disclosing, discussing or confirming security issues “until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available.”
* Apple advises all users to install this Safari update to make their systems more secure and less susceptible to attacks.
* You can apply the free Safari update using the Mac’s Software Update mechanism or download the installer directly from Apple’s website.
