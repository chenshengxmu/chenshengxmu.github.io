* Perhaps it’s just me, but it seems like awesome free jailbreak tweaks are more of the exception than the norm these days. For that reason, it’s always refreshing to see a good tweak that’s free, as is the case with WeeToolbox.
* WeeToolbox adds five different functions — Tweet, Dial, Flashlight, Pastie, and Camera — to Notification Center, and it’s completely free…
* While the majority of the functions are fairly obvious, the Pastie.org function may require a bit of explaining. Basically it takes the contents of your clipboard, and sends it to Pastie.org. Once you tap the Pastie button, a new url will be placed in your clipboard linking you to your Pastie content. Everything else is self explanatory.
* If your iOS 5 device is jailbroken, mosey on over to Cydia’s BigBoss repo and download it today, and then be sure to tell us what you think about it in the comments below. Again, this is a free tweak.
