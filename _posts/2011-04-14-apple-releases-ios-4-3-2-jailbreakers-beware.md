* Barely 3 weeks after releasing iOS 4.3.1, Apple just released iOS 4.3.2 for iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPad, iPad 2, iPod Touch 3G and 4G.The Verizon CDMA iPhone also gets an update, but not 4.3.2. The Verizon iPhone gets iOS 4.2.7.
* As expected, this new software update was released to fix a FaceTime bug we reported about last week. The changelog shows that iOS 4.3.2 also fixes an issue that prevented international users from connecting to 3G networks on iPad. As usual, this update also includes the “latest security updates”…
* Jailbreakers beware! Do not install iOS 4.3.2 if you care about your jailbreak or unlock. iOS 4.3.2 for the various iDevices can be downloaded from our downloads section.
