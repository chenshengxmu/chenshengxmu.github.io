* New photos posted on China social media site Sina Weibo and shared by HDBlog on Monday point to the rumored, larger, iPad Pro having two ports – if the photos prove to be legitimate. The images were first shared by VandaagApple in February.
* The unconfirmed photos show an iPad with the typical Apple logo, rear-camera, and side volume buttons. However curiously, there’s a port of some sorts on the left side of the device, something never before seen on the iPad line.
* It’s not clear what type of port is being shown. However knowing Apple, it could be a second Lightning port, or more likely, a USB-C port that was first featured on the new MacBook.
* Rumors have pointed to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro to be aimed at enterprise users. It would make sense for Apple to include a second port for support of a broader range of accessories. If the side port was USB-C it could power HDMI output, useful for business presentations and keyboard and mouse support.
* The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in March that the iPad Pro will feature a USB 3.0 port for accessories. The well-connected Apple publication also shared production has been pushed back until September, rather than the current quarter as previously reported. Following the unveiling of USB-C on the new MacBook instead of USB 3.0, the former seems much more likely.
* There have been inaccurate leaks for past cases and mockups, so take this with a grain of salt. If anything, it serves as a nice mockup of what Apple will probably feature on its next iPad.
* Should Apple ditch Lightning completely and just opt for USB-C as the new standard?
