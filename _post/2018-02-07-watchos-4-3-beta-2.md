* Apple on Wednesday seeded the second beta of watchOS 4.3 to developers. Registered developers with the proper configuration profile can install the update over-the-air by navigating to the Software Update tab in the Apple Watch iPhone app.
* WatchOS 4.3 isn’t quite the update as its 11.3 companion, but it does add a few notable features and improvements. There’s Nightstand mode in portrait (was landscape-only), a new charging animation, Music app control of iPhone music, and more.
