---
* As usual, Apple event started with Steve Jobs throwing some big numbers in our face: 250 million iPods sold, 284 retail stores that saw over 250 million visitors, 140,000 apps, 3 billion applications downloaded, all this wrapped in some exciting adjectives such as ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, ‚Äúexciting‚Äù, ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù, ‚Äúphenomenal‚Äù, ‚Äúincredible‚Äù, etc‚Ä¶ Uncle Steve sure knows how to warm up a crowd!
* Let‚Äôs cut to the chase. Here is everything you need to know about the iPad.

* That‚Äôs about all I could catch from the presentation. I might have missed a few things, so feel free to feel in the blanks if I forgot anything. I‚Äôm currently in Bali and I‚Äôve stayed up all night. It‚Äôs 4am here and I need some sleep.
* A big thank you to gdgt for the images and the amazing live blogging coverage.
* My quick thoughts about the iPad? I‚Äôm not impressed. At all! This is nothing more than a big iPhone. What do you think about the iPad? I look forward to reading your comments when I get up in about 18 hours üòâ
