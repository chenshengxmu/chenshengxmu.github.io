* Apple’s iTunes Festival at SXSW in Austin, Texas is kicking off at 8pm Pacific / 11pm Eastern and the music video service Vevo just announced on its blog that it will live stream all of the performances through through its Apple TV channel and its free mobile apps for the iPhone and iPad.
* Select performances will be available following each show, Vevo has noted. The five-day event runs from March 11 through March 15 at ACL Live at the Moody Theater.
* In addition to Vevo, Apple itself will provide a free live and on-demand stream via the iTunes Store on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac or PC devices, as well as in high-definition through the newly-refreshed iTunes Festival app, available free of charge for iOS devices and as a channel on the Apple TV media-streaming box…
* You’d be forgiven for wondering why on Earth would Apple dilute its own coverage by allowing its customers to watch iTunes Festival through Vevo. Although Apple actually has partnered with Vevo on this, it’s not like the company needs Vevo’s money, right?
* I think Apple’s goal here is to bring iTunes Festival to as many eyeballs as possible. Don’t forget that Vevo has essentially become the MTV for the Internet generation so clearly it’s a win-win for both parties.
* Besides, Vevo is a partner – they have a 24/7 music video Apple TV channel.
* Can’t make it to Austin? We’re streaming each night of #iTunesFestival at SXSW on VEVO! More: http://t.co/ZEoemI6oMc pic.twitter.com/30SVYVkEkM
