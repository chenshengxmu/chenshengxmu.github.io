* Periscope for iPhone, a Twitter-owned live-broadcasting app, was updated Thursday with a few new features, including one that lets you browse live broadcasts on a world map by location.
* You’ll notice a new Map option under the Global section within the app. Tap it for a nicely done zoomable map which highlights live streams relevant to your current location.
* This feature uses geolocation so live broadcasts that have not been tagged with location won’t appear here.
* If you ever used Periscope, you know that once you stop broadcasting the app starts uploading a replay of your video. But shouldn’t replays be recorded server-side?
* Well, now they are: your live stream will be instantly available for replay right after you have finished broadcasting.
* I’m most excited about the ability to share the link to a broadcast I’m watching on Twitter, which before today used to be a multi-step, tedious copy-paste process.
* Lastly, this edition of Periscope expands localization to an additional 29 countries.
* Periscope 1.1 changelog:
* The 13.3-megabyte app requires an iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 7.1 or later.
* Periscope is free in the App Store.
