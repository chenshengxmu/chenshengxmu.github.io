* ColorBadges is an upcoming jailbreak tweak that was recently submitted to Cydia’s BigBoss repo. It allows users to colorize app badges based on the color of the app icon. For example, if you have a badge on the Cydia app, the color of the badge will be brown, which corresponds to the color of the Cydia app.
* Along with the addition of app matching color to the badges, ColorBadges adds an outline to the outside of the badge to make the color stand out even more. ColorBadges is a great looking jailbreak tweak, and I think that it significantly improves the look of app badges. It makes it so that you don’t mind having tons of app badges proliferating your Home screen, and that’s saying a lot.
* Take a look at our full video walkthrough of ColorBadges after the break…
* Once you install ColorBadges it should immediately start working. There are no options or settings to configure for the tweak, just install it and go.

* The only downside I was able to find for ColorBadges, is that the badges that are placed on folders aren’t changed at all. ColorBadges’ developer, David Goldman, noted to me that this was the case, and recommended that users who wanted to change the look of folder badges check out another tweak called BadgeCustomizer. Here’s hoping that David will build-in a way to customize the default look of app badges in a future update.

* Unfortunately, folder badges aren’t influenced by ColorBadges’ presence
* Despite the lack of badge theming on folder badges, ColorBadges is a tweak that I can wholeheartedly recommend. It makes app badges look really good, and there’s not a lot of cumbersome setup to wade through.

* ColorBadges, once it officially drops on Cydia, will be available to purchase for $0.99. I think that’s a fair asking price for something that easily improves the look of the iOS Home screen. What do you think?
