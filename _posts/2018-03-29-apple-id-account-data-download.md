* Apple is revamping its privacy controls to comply with new European law, as per Bloomberg.
* Author Mark Gurman has learned from his sources that the Cupertino technology giant is planning to launch an overhauled Apple ID website in May. These new web-based tools should help users take better control of their data by allowing them to download a copy of all information stored in their Apple ID, including services, apps and purchases data.
* For instance, you’ll be able to download all information stored in the stock Contacts, Calendar and Contacts apps, in addition to your iCloud-synced media such as photos and videos and preferences like songs you streamed through Apple Music.
* The refreshed website will also make it easier to delete or deactivate your Apple ID account, as well as correct your personal information. Of course, the ability to get your data or delete an account is currently available online in various locations or by calling AppleCare.
* AppleInsider has verified with Apple that this new initiative will basically consolidate these upcoming features in one portal. The changes will comply with the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect on May 25.
* These privacy tools will first launch in Europe in early May before expanding to other markets.
