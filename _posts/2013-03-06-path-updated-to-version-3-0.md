* Personal social network Path released a significant update to its iOS app this afternoon, bringing the software to version 3.0. The update includes your usual bug fixes and improvements, as well as two new major features.
* The first one is private messaging, allowing you to talk with your Path friends in real time and share various types of media. And the other is The Shop—a digital content store of sorts, with premium photo filters and more…
* Here are the official release notes:
* As you’ve come to expect from Path, the new instant messaging feature is gorgeous. It”s also rather functional, as it supports the sending of locations, stickers, songs, books, movies, photos and videos, as well as group messaging.
* The Shop is similarly well-crafted with sharp graphics and a snappy UI. Unfortunately, all that’s available for purchase right now are ‘Sticker packs,’ which appear to only work in messaging, and premium filters for photos and videos.
* While the two new features are great, for folks who already frequent the social network, I doubt that they’ll help attract new users. I signed up  around the time they debuted the 2.0 update, and I don’t know if I’ve logged in 10 times since.
* Nevertheless, if you want to see the new Path for yourself, you can find it in the App Store for free. It’s universal, so it will work with both your iPhone and iPad.
* What do you think of Path 3.0?
