* In addition to iOS 10.2, Apple on Monday also released the first betas for macOS Sierra 10.12.2, watchOS 3.1.1, and tvOS 10.1 to developers. Folks belonging to Apple’s developer program can install the updates via their respective over-the-air mechanisms.
* It’s not known yet what changes these updates include, but we expect them to be more along the lines of bug fixes and improvements, rather than major new features. A week ago, Apple released macOS Sierra 10.12.1, watchOS 3.1 and tvOS 10.0.1.
* Find something new we haven’t mentioned? Let us know down in the comments below!
