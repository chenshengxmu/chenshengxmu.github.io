* In a broad reflective piece on Apple’s WWDC keynote, noted tech journalist Walt Mossberg made some interesting comments regarding a recent rumor that Apple was considering bringing its iMessage service to Android. Turns out that isn’t happening, and won’t be in the near future.
* Speaking to a “senior Apple executive,” Mossberg says Apple is happy with the 1 billion+ active devices it currently caters to, so it doesn’t feel an immediate need to grow its user base by expanding to other platforms. It also still considers its iMessage service a major iOS-exclusive feature.
* When I asked a senior Apple executive why iMessage wasn’t being expanded to other platforms, he gave two answers. First, he said, Apple considers its own user base of 1 billion active devices to provide a large enough data set for any possible AI learning the company is working on. And, second, having a superior messaging platform that only worked on Apple devices would help sales of those devices — the company’s classic (and successful) rationale for years.
* Apple has significantly upped the ante for competing messaging services with iMessage in iOS 10. It’s adding a number of new features including better emoji, colorful effects and animations, and support for apps so you can make payments and order food without leaving the Messages app.
