* Like Windows, OS X makes having apps, documents, folders or server connections launch automatically whenever you log in to your Mac as easy as dragging them to the System Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Items section.
* Sometimes, one or more Login Items may cause software problems or prevent your computer from starting up properly.
* Rather than remove all of your Login Items permanently, here’s how you can temporarily prevent them from opening automatically when you log in, without needing to adjust your settings.
* 1) Restart your Mac by selecting Restart in the Apple menu, or press the Power (⎋) key to turn on your computer if it’s already turned off.
* 2) Do one of the following:

* Make sure you hold the Shift (⇧) key when logging in, then release it when you see the Dock. This shall prevent your Login Items from loading.

* To prevent Login Items from loading when you restart or turn on your Mac, hold down the Shift (⇧) when OS X’s progress bar shows up on the startup screen. The startup screen appears after the startup chord plays. Release the key when the desktop shows up.
* And there you have it, this is how you prevent both Login Items and previously opened Finder windows from being launched when your Mac boots, without removing any entries from the Login Items preference pane.
