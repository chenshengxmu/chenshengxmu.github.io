* Spotify is one of the most popular alternatives to Apple Music on the iOS platform, but like all music streaming apps, it can really take a bite out of your cellular data if you’re not careful.
* In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to configure your Spotify premium subscription responsibly so you can use it to your liking without blowing through all of your cellular data.
* If you’re always on the go, then you probably won’t have Wi-Fi around all the time, which means you’re probably going to be stuck on a cellular network when you want to listen to your music.
* There are some steps capped data users can follow to mitigate data usage from the app, but worry not, as it won’t necessarily hinder the quality of your user experience.
* To set Spotify up for the best efficiency on a cellular network, you are going to want to configure a few settings. Follow these steps:
* 1) Launch the Spotify app and tap on the Your Library tab.

* 2) Open the Streaming Quality cell.
* 3) Set the stream quality to Automatic.
* 4) Set the download quality to Extreme.
* 5) Disable the Download Using Cellular option.
* Spotify lets you download all of your favorite songs for offline listening. Personally, I recommend setting the download quality to Extreme, which is the highest possible at 320 kbit/s. This way, you have the highest quality songs cached on your device before you even leave your Wi-Fi network at home.
* We’ve set the streaming quality to automatic because this lets the app choose the best quality for you depending on your situation. If you’re on a cellular network, it’s going to optimize the streaming quality of non-cached songs to reduce data usage and prevent buffering issues. Conversely, it should stream on higher quality when you’re on Wi-Fi. Ultimately, this is what we want.
* We’re also disabling the Download Using Cellular option because we only want songs to download for offline listening when we’re connected to a Wi-Fi network. This, like the setting discussed in the previous paragraph, reduces data usage. Songs you’ve already downloaded for offline use aren’t going to impact your cellular data in any way.
* If you use Spotify, and you have a capped data plan, these are the settings I would recommend for you.
* I used to be on a 2GB AT&T data plan, and luckily, these settings always kept me under my cap even after hours of use. I utilized Wi-Fi for my higher-quality offline downloads, and I set up Spotify to be light on the cellular data.
* Granted now I have a much larger data plan and I can get away with higher quality streaming these days, I still keep the Download Using Cellular option turned off at the very least.
