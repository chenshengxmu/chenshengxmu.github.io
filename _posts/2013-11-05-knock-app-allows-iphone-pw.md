* With the iPhone 5s, Apple made security more convenient by allowing users to unlock their devices with a quick tap of its Touch ID Home button. It’s kind of like having a password, without having to type it in every time.
* And that’s essentially what Knock, a new iOS app by Knock Software, does for the Mac. It allows you to keep your computer secure, without having to type in a password every time. Simply give your iPhone a knock to unlock…
* How does it work? After installing Knock to both your iPhone and Mac, you’ll pair them using a secure, low-power connection. Then, anytime your iPhone’s within Bluetooth range, you can knock twice to unlock your computer.
* From the App Store’s description:
* “Faster and safer than typing a password, for iOS and Mac.
* You keep your iPhone with you all the time. Now you can use it as a password. You never have to open the app— just knock on your phone twice, even when it’s in your pocket, and you’re in.
* Using Knock won’t drain your iPhone’s battery, even if you use it all day every day. Knock securely communicates with your Mac using Bluetooth Low Energy, a new technology that draws very little power.”
* And here’s a video of Knock in action:

* As always, it’s cool to see developers think outside the box to help make tedious tasks more bearable. I believe we’ve seen a few apps similar to this, but even so, Knock looks polished, convenient, and I can’t wait to try it out.
* Keep in mind that because it uses Bluetooth 4.0, your computer and iPhone must support the technology. That means you’ll need an iPhone 4s or newer, and a 2011 MacBook Air/2012 MacBook Pro/2012 iMac/2011 Mac mini or newer.
* If you meet those requirements, and want to check it out, you can find the Knock iOS app in the App Store for $3.99, and the accompanying Mac app on the Knock website, for free.
* So, what are your thoughts on Knock?
