* Welcome to the latest edition of iDB’s ongoing Gift Ideas series, where we provide curated roundups of some of our favorite products. Throughout the year we cover and test a number of devices and accessories, so we decided to use that experience to help those searching for the perfect present. Today’s roundup is focused on gift ideas for high-tech chefs.

* Apple’s larger iPad Pro makes for the perfect kitchen companion. Its 12.9-inch display is great for watching how-to cooking videos or reading recipes, and the enhanced stereo speakers will play everything from ambient music to news podcasts, and everything in between. If that’s not enough to convince you, the powerful tablet is also good for playing games, watching movies and sketching with Apple’s popular Pencil stylus.
* You can buy this 12.9-inch iPad Pro for $730.
* Bonus: add on this iPad Pro stand from Logitech for constant charging and the perfect viewing angle.

* Of course you can’t be a high-tech chef without a smart, connected scale. There are plenty of them out there, but this one from Drop features a non-slip silicone design and it syncs with a companion iPad recipe app so you can weigh out ingredients. Additionally, simple ingredient substitutions and various single-bowl recipes make this scale perfect for beginners and its wireless button means no need to touch your tablet with dirty fingers.
* You can buy the Drop Kitchen Connected Kitchen Scale for $70.

* Let Triby’s Smart Speaker be your sous-chef. This portable speaker features a magnetic back so it can hang securely on your fridge, Internet radio, hands-free speakerphone, and connected message board you can create messages using the companion smartphone app. Its most useful feature, however, is Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. Just say the wake word “Alexa” and you can set timers, control smart home devices, get the news and play music—all hands-free using simple voice commands.
* You can buy the Triby Smart Speaker for $100.
* Alternative: if you don’t like the Triby, the Amazon Echo has most of the same features and none of the quirkiness.

* This award-winning accessory allows you to keep an eye on your grill or smoker from up to 150 feet away. Simply attach the magnetic iGrill mini to your grill, connect it to your smartphone via Bluetooth, select what you’re cooking in the iDevices Connected app and you’ll get an alert when your food is ready. The iGrill mini’s single probe measures temperatures between -22F and 572F and its temperature LED indicator shows progression so no need to lift the lid.
* You can buy the iGrill mini Smart Thermometer for $24.

* Using the Crock-Pot Smart Slow Cooker with WeMo-enabled technology, you can easily increase or decrease cooking time, turn the temperature up or down, switch the slow cooker to keep-warm mode or turn it completely off, all using the free WeMo app on your smart device. Other features include a roomy 6-quart, stainless steel design, handy cord storage and an easy-to-clean cooker. Of course the Crock-Pot can be used without all of the smart features, but then you wouldn’t be a high-tech chef, would you?
* You can buy the Crock-Pot Wemo Smart Slow Cooker for $104.

* I know it feels like throwing the word “smart” in front of a kitchen gadget is more gimmicky than useful, but the Anova Precision Cooker is a well-reviewed chef’s tool that lets you truly cook remotely. Using its adjustable clamp, attach it to any pot or tank you’re cooking in, connect it to your smartphone, and you’ll receive push notifications when it reads preheating, goal temperature, and when time is finished. And thanks to its removable steel skirt, cleanup is quick and easy.
* You can buy the Anova Culinary Precision Cooker for $150.

* We’ve mentioned the UE BOOM 2 Bluetooth speaker in a few gift guides already, and I have no problem doing it again. It’s perfect for folks who want a non-smart wireless speaker to play music in the kitchen while cooking or congregating. The BOOM 2 features brilliant 360-degree sound, 15+ hours of battery life, and a durable, waterproof exterior to save it from accidental spills and drops.
* You can buy the UE BOOM 2 Bluetooth speaker for $150 (sale price).
* Alternative: for a less expensive option with similar features, check out the JBL Flip 3.

* It’s not necessarily high-tech, but every chef loves a new cookbook. If they’re hip with the times, chances are they already have it, but if they don’t then may I suggest Thug Kitchen: The Official Cookbook. It features over 100 top recipes from the hit blog with the same name, easy-to-follow instructions, and beautiful photos. Now there’s some strong language in here, and the recipes are very unconventional (see roasted beer and lime cauliflower tacos), so it’s not going to be for everyone. But it’s worth noting that this book hit #1 on the New York Times Bestseller List, as did its multiple sequels.
* You can buy Thug Kitchen: The Official Cookbook for $12.

* The Smart Oven Pro does the thinking for you. This 1800 watt countertop oven automatically adjusts its independent heating elements to ensure an exact cooking process. 10 menu functions suggest the ideal temperature and time, and the oven remembers them for the next use. It also comes with an interior oven light so you can monitor your cooking progress, and a slow cook function designed for long cook times at low temperatures to tenderize and develop complex flavors.
* You can buy the Breville Smart Over Pro for $255.

* Ok, allow me to throw one more smart kitchen utility at you: the Pantelligent Intelligent Frying Pan. It’s embedded with a hidden sensor that measures temperature from the moment food touches its surface. So you choose the recipe you want to cook and the Pantelligent app will instantly sync with your pan and tell you when to flip, add ingredients and when your food is done. All you have to do is watch and listen for the prompts and you’ll be guaranteed a perfect dish every single time.
* You can buy the Pantelligent Intelligent Frying Pan for $129.
