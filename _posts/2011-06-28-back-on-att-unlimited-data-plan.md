* AT&T no longer offers its new or existing customer’s unlimited data. This is unfortunate, but not permanent. This method will allow you to have unlimited data for use with any phone on any account on the AT&T Wireless network.
* This guide is the culmination of several people’s struggles in getting AT&T to give them back something they deserve. Originally posted back in October and updated a little while after, we’re back to give it to you again! This time with an easier to follow guide!
* The following is a guest post by my good Twitter friend Mathew Rice.
* The first thing you need to do is obtain a First Generation iPhone, commonly known as the iPhone 2G and how we will refer to it from here on out. Once you’ve obtained an iPhone 2G, you’ll want to give it a full restore in iTunes. You can do this with your SIM card installed or without. You’ll have to put your SIM card in later anyways, so if you don’t need to use your actual phone while the process completes, then install your SIM and save yourself a step later.
* Once the restore has completed, iTunes will bring you to the phone activation screen (assuming your SIM card is installed, if it’s not, disconnect your iPhone, insert the SIM card and reconnect your iPhone). Fill in the required account info and proceed. Whatever options you choose during activation won’t really matter as certain account features you already have will override, like unlimited family messaging and the likes. As well, the great part about this portion of the process is that Unlimited data is non-optional :p – At the end of the activation process, iTunes should tell you something like, “You’ll receive an email when your activation is complete”. Once you’ve got the email, all is well and you now have an Unlimited Data plan.
* You can verify this many ways like dialing *DATA# from your phone. You’ll then receive a text message with details about your data plan where it will indicate you have unlimited data. You can also log-in to your AT&T account online and go to the features portion of your account to see unlimited data for whichever phone line you used during activation.
* Read on for info on known issues and for answers to frequently asked questions.
* If the iPhone 2G you are using is still assigned to another AT&T account, activation might not complete, you might not receive the activation complete email and after a long wait, you will get an, “unable to complete activation email”. This is the most common reason for failed activations. If you know the account assignment status of the iPhone 2G, make sure you replace the iPhone 2G on that account with another phone first. This means AT&T has to have the replacement phone on-file for the account that once had the iPhone 2G you are using.
* Resolution – You’ll need to call AT&T and have them manually activate the phone for you. It helps to tell them you were trying to activate your unlimited data iPhone plan through iTunes with your iPhone. As well, you can go to any company owned AT&T store and they can get you setup as well. Make sure to bring the iPhone 2G with you and that you are or have with you, the primary account holder.
* What if I am on a Family Plan? Answer: The process is the same, just make sure you are or know the account info of the primary account holder
* What if I am on an Employee Plan? Answer: The process is the same, just make sure you are or know the account info of the primary account holder
* My microSIM card does not fit in this iPhone 2G! Answer: That’s right; you’ll need to get a microSIM adapter or a Standard SIM card. You can get the latter from any company owned AT&T store. They can also take care of the whole process for you too. So if you go that route, have them set you up. Make sure to bring the iPhone 2G with you.
* I got a text message from AT&T telling me they switched my data plan! Answer: This is normal, if you place your SIM card into an AT&T known smartphone like an iPhone 3G or newer, AT&T will automatically switch you to the $30 unlimited data plan. This is because the iTunes quoted $20 unlimited data plan is only qualified for iPhone 2G devices. No worries though, you still have unlimited data! Go on, check, dial *DATA# :p
* Your Guide Sucks, it didn’t work for me! Answer: This guide is for reference only. There are no guarantees nor where there any given. However, are you sure you followed all the steps and read carefully? Are you or do you have the primary account holders info? Make sure you are or do! You can also check out the original article and sift through the comments to see if anyone else has had a similar issue like yours.
