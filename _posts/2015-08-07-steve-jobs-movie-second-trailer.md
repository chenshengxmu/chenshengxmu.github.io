* Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle’s’s ‘Steve Jobs’ film is scheduled to hit movie theaters in the United States on October 9 so movie producers began airing a brand new TV trailer on television in an effort to drum up publicity for the forthcoming flick.
* The 60-second video flashes between scenes depicting Steve’s meticulous preparations for Apple’s carefully choreographed product presentations and ones reflecting on his troubled relationship with Lisa, Jobs’s first daughter who appears to be the ”heroine of the film” as the director put it.
* Apple’s mercurial co-founder is played by Michael Fassbender, Seth Rogan is Steve Wozniak and Kate Winslet plays Joanna Hoffman. Jobs’s daughter Lisa is played by actresses Perla Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo and Makenzie Moss who portray her at different ages.

* As mentioned before, Lisa Nicole Brennan-Jobs is the first child of Steve Jobs and his high school girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan. The couple first met at Homestead High School in 1972 and had an on/off relationship for the next five years.
* When Chrisann became pregnant, Steve publicly denied paternity even after a DNA test established him as the father. Chrisann then left their shared home, ending the relationship abruptly and supporting herself by cleaning houses.
* Steve would eventually come to senses.
* Years after being forced out of Apple in a boardroom coup, he reconciled with his daughter under the influence of his newly found biological sister, the American author Mona Simpson.
* Steve famously name a computer project he was working on before the ouster, the Apple Lisa, after his daughter.
* Ahead of its October 9 theatrical release, ‘Steve Jobs’ will be shown at the New York Film Festival on October 3. What are your expectations for this film and do you plan on watching it?
