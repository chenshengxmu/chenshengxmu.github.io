* Google has just announced its brand new Android Wear platform for powering wearable devices like smartwatches and handset maker Motorola is already showing off its first Android Wear-driven device, a smartwatch dubbed Moto 360.
* Billed as a “modern timepiece,” the device indeed is designed much like classic timepieces and sports high-grade finish that oozes premium quality.
* The Moto 360, of course, runs Android Wear and includes Google Now integration, Android notifications, apps like weather, sports scores and more. It does gestures, too. “With just a twist of the wrist,” Motorola writes, you can see who’s emailing or calling, what time your next meeting is or a friend’s latest social post…
* Motorola says its device tells you what you need to know before you know you need it, through subtle Google Now alerts and notifications.
* It supports ‘Ok Google’ functionality which lets you ask questions like what time your flight leaves, or schedule an appointment, send a text message, set an alarm, take a note and more – much like Siri does on iOS devices.
* The Moto 360 features a round face and premium materials, making it feel “comfortable and familiar” on your wrist. Here, check out a few press shots of the device.

* “It’s everything you need, with a look that you want,” says the pitch.
* Motorola says its smartwatch will be available globally this summer, starting in the United States. The Moto 360 will come in a variety of styles, said the firm, including the classic leather look and the premium metal finish, both depicted right below.

* Google said earlier today that Android Wear launch partners include hardware vendors Asus, HTC, LG, Motorola and Samsung, chip makers Broadcom, Imagination, Intel, Mediatek and Qualcomm and such fashion labels as the Fossil Group.
* First watches powered by Android Wear should arrive “later this year,” Google promised.
* In addition to Motorola, Google’s announcement today was quickly followed by LG’s unveiling of the Android Wear-powered G Watch, Engadget reported.
* To learn more about the Moto 360, check out the official website.
* For reference, Google is in the process of unloading Motorola Mobility unit, with China’s Lenovo Group emerging as a likely buyer for $2.9 billion. The search monster paid an astounding $12.5 billion for Motorola back in 2011.
* Wouldn’t you want to slap the Moto 360 on your wrist?
