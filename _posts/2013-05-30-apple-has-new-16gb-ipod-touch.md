* This is kind of interesting. Without cryptic event invites or rampant speculation, Apple just introduced a new product. No, it’s not the iWatch or anything like that. It’s just a new version of its fifth generation iPod touch.
* As most of you know, Apple  unveiled the 5th-gen touch during its iPhone 5 event last fall. But up until now, it’s only been available in 32GB and 64GB. The new one comes with 16GB of storage, and few other changes…
* As noted by The Verge, Apple has started listing 16GB late-gen iPod touch in its US web store tonight. It’s virtually identical to the other models with a 4-inch Retina display, dual-core A5 processor, and front-facing camera.
* But it is missing some things. Most notably, there’s no rear-facing iSight camera. And it also appears to be missing the lanyard hook. Unfortunately, the lack of components doesn’t make it any thinner, as it’s still 6.1mm thick.
* It does make it cheaper though. At $229, the 16GB iPod touch is about $70 less than its 32GB sibling. I’m not sure if that’s really worth losing the camera over, but if you’re interested, the 16GB is in stock and shipping immediately.
* Will you be picking one up?
