* Just 24 hours after iOS 10.2 beta 7 dropped and three days following macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta 5, Apple on Thursday issued a sixth beta of what would become the second major update to macOS Sierra. macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta 6 (build number 16C63a) is now available to registered developers.
* The update can be deployed via the Mac App Store’s Updates tab on Macs which are registered with the Apple Developer Program. The full installer is on Dev Center.
* Aside from bug fixes and performance improvements, macOS 10.12.2 won’t make your daily computing more productive but you’ll enjoy Apple’s new “Color Burst” wallpapers from MacBook Pro marketing and a ton of new Unicode 9.0 emoji characters.
* These include clown face, drooling face, selfie, face palm, fox face, owl, shark, butterfly, avocado, pancakes, croissant and more, pus several profession emoji in both male and female genders, such as firefighter, mechanic, lawyer, doctor and scientist.
* The new emoji sets will be available in iOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.1, too.
* macOS Sierra 10.12.2 should release next week. We’ll keep you posted and update this article with any outward-facing new features if and when we encounter them.
