* AndroidLock XT has been out for a very long time, but for some strange reason I never got around to trying it. Recently, an Ice Cream Sandwich aka Android 4.0 theme was released for AndroidLock XT, so I was compelled to give it a go.
* Check inside for a hands-on demonstration of AndroidLock XT, along with the new theme that makes your iPhone’s Lock screen look and feel like Ice Cream Sandwich…
* First and foremost I have to state that AndroidLock XT is a very well thought out Lock screen alternative to the iPhone’s passcode or password lock options. It obviously doesn’t feel as secure as a password, or even a passcode, but it’ll do unless you require the security.
* The Ice Cream Sandwich theme, while not an exact pixel by pixel replica of a real Android 4.0 device, is pretty spot on. The developer of the theme has been releasing small updates to make it more closely in line with the real thing.
* If you’re interested in turning your Lock screen into a pattern based unlocking experience and your device is jailbroken, you can purchase AndroidLock XT on Cydia for the reasonable price of $1.49. The Ice Cream Sandwich theme, and many other themes for that matter, are free downloads.
* What do you think about adding a pattern based unlocking scheme to the iPhone? Do you like it, or do you think it’s just not right?
