* WidgeficationX is a new free jailbreak tweak by Justin Petkovic that lets you customize the look of your widgets and notification banners by modifying their transparency values.
* The tweak has a system-wide effect on your device, so you’ll see the changes throughout your many iPhone or iPad interfaces, whether you’re on the Lock screen, Home screen, or viewing Notification Center.
* Above, you can see just a few of the different ways it can be used to customize your widgets. For reference, the screenshot below shows you what they look like on a stock device:

* These effects can also be applied to your banner notifications throughout iOS:

* I think the effects are best applied to the widgets only because some of the configurations for the banners can make it really hard to read your notifications when they pop up anywhere else in iOS, such as when you’re on the Home screen or in another app.
* Since the widgets are always in the same place with a blurred background behind them, they’re not really any more difficult to read no matter what effect you choose to use.
* WidgeficationX adds a preferences pane to the Settings app where you’ll be able to configure what kinds of transparency effect you want to use for each your banners and widgets:

* The options are a little bit confusing at a first glance, so to make things as simple as possible, follow the outlines below:
* For widgets, these settings have the following effects:
* For banners, these settings have the following effects:
* You can also use the flat rectangular mask option to remove the rounded corners from banners and widgets if you don’t like them, and a respring button is also included so you can save your changes each time you make them.
* In my own opinion, the sleek unified mask looks the best out of all the options, but your mileage may vary depending on your own tastes.
* If you’re interested in trying the WidgeficationX (iOS 10) tweak, you can download it for free from Cydia’s BigBoss repository today. The tweak works on jailbroken iOS 10 devices.
