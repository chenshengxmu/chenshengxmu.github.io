* If you’re anything like me, chances are you have amassed a photo library that spans years of personal memories and moments you care about. And like many Mac owners, you no doubt like to personalize your computer’s desktop with custom wallpapers.
* Exporting an image to a folder in the Finder, and then adding that folder in the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System Preferences is one way to use your favorite photos as desktop wallpapers.
* However, Photos for Mac has a built-in option for quickly setting any image in your photo library as a desktop wallpaper. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to set any image in the Photos app as your Mac’s wallpaper without the need to export files and deal with duplicate copies.
* Step 1: Launch Photos on your Mac.
* Step 2: Select an album or moment, and then highlight a single image you would like to set as your desktop wallpaper.
