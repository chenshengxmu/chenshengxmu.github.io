* DigiTimes, the-sometimes-reliable Taiwanese trade publication, on Monday ran a report which quotes sources with Taiwan’s supply chain who claim that a fifth revision to Apple’s full-size 9.7-inch iPad will be 25-33 percent lighter than its previous generation.
* The fifth-generation iPad is believed to be entering trial production next month, meaning the device should be on track for a rumored September launch. Initial output is pegged at up to three million units until Apple and its manufacturing partners reach yield levels necessary to ramp up production…
* DigiTimes reports:
* The display of the new iPad, which will hit market shelves as early as September, will still be a 2,048 x 1,536 Retina display, the same as the one used in the 4th-generation model, except that the new display is built on a glass substrate of 0.2mm, thinner than the 0.25mm one for the 4th-generation device, the sources said, adding the new table will has a narrow bezel.
* The iPad 5 should be a third lighter than its predecessor thanks to a single backlighting bar, as opposed to two LED bars used in the iPad 4. It’s also expected to incorporate the GF2 touch panel technology that combines a layer of glass with two layers of ITO film, as opposed to G/G bonding used in the iPad 3 and 4.
* The report asserts LG Display, Samsung Display and Sharp are supplying screens for the iPad 5.
* Taiwan Surface Mounting Technology will undertake SMT for the LED light bars, while Radiant Opto-Electronics and Coretronic are thought to make the backlight. Additionally, Apple’s partner TPK Holding is reportedly responsible for touch panel bonding.

* The DigiTimes story actually matches up with KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who also expects the next full-size iPad by Fall. Kuo, who is arguably the most reliable Apple analyst, told clients to expect a “significantly lighter and slimmer” than previous versions.
* Recent checks and leaks indicate the iPad 5 will adopt the iPad mini’s design, meaning a narrower screen border. As you know, Apple with the iPad mini introduction in October 2012 introduced the iOS multi-touch enhancements that solve the user experience problems stemming from the skinnier side bezels.
* Speaking of which, is your next tablet going to be an iPad 5 or iPad mini 2?
* I’m definitely saving my money for a Retina iPad mini.
