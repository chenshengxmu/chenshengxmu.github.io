* Apple’s new look and feel in iOS 7 is certainly polarizing, that much is clear. While approximately half of those who took part in our informal iOS 7 makeover poll said they loved the new design, nearly a third think the new interface will take some time getting used to. While the vast majority seem to support the facelift, a lot of people have taken issue with the new iOS 7 icons.
* Complaints range from the icons being too colourful and out of place to being completely different from each other to resembling a terrible Photoshop job by a 14-yer-old. We’ll let you be the judge: here’s a side-by-side comparison of iOS 6 vs iOS 7 icons…
* Hat tip to @pawsupforu for passing along the handy graphics.

* Having installed iOS 7 on my iPhone 5, I must say that I’m in support of the redesign.
* This includes the icons which I obviously don’t think are ugly, quite the contrary.
* What I have noticed, however, is that the icons in iOS 7 use really vivid colors, almost as if Apple designed them for an AMOLED display.
* Who knows, maybe the oversaturated nature of iOS 7 icons is in preparation for the next iPhone and iPad?
* After all, the rumor mill has been saying for quite some time that future iDevices will adopt Sharp’s IGZO panels and those provide more vivid colors and deeper blacks
* Anyway, which do you prefer, the iOS 6 icons or the revamped iOS 7 ones?
