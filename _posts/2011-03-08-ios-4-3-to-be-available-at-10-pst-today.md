* According to Boy Genius Report, iOS 4.3 will be available today at 10AM PST. That’s a full three days before it was expected to be available, but the earlier the better if you ask me.
* The folks at Apple said that it would be available on the day of the iPad’s 2 launch — March 11th, but I guess they decided it would be best to stagger the release date a bit.
* One of the positive aspects regarding an early release is that this will give the jailbreak community even more time to jump on providing a jailbreak and solving the ASLR issues surrounding Apple’s latest firmware…
* There’s also the issue of providing a long awaited unlock for the latest basebands that came courtesy of iOS 4.2.1. We know there are plenty of people, including some of us, that have been patiently waiting for quite some time.
* Last but not least, it’s probably a good idea to heed the warning shots that come out alongside every new firmware release. If you care about your jailbreak, your unlock, or even the possibility of ever being able to unlock, then hold off on updating until a safe method is provided.
* We will let you know when it is safe to make the jump to iOS 4.3. If you don’t care about unlocking or jailbreaking, then by all means, feel free to update via iTunes.
* It’s almost here folks, what do you think?
