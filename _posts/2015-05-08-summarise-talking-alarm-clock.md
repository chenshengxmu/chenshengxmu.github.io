* There is a number of different alarm clock apps available in the App Store. If you have trouble getting out of bed, you can ask Carrot to wake you up. If you prefer a lighter touch, Rise is a bit mellower.
* Summarise – Talking Alarm Clock is an alarm clock that wakes you up with the news, a list of emails, your day’s schedule, and more. In addition to showing you what is in store for you today, Summarise uses Siri’s voice to read to you, too.
* Setup is quick and easy. Even if you are half asleep, you can add content. Tap the plus (+) icon to add a new panel. Then, select from Weather, News, Mail, Reminders, and more. Then, set the time you wish to wake up and you’ll be ready to go before your head hits the pillow.

* Weather adds the day’s forecast based on your current location. So, no matter where you are, you’ll know what to expect, hour-by-hour. The app reads you the current condition, plus the highs and lows for the day.
* News is powered by Feedly. Type the name of a website into the search bar (like iDownloadBlog) and it will be added to your morning news feed.
* Log in to your mail account to add it to the panel. You can add multiple accounts and have a quick view of all of them, right when you wake up.
* When you add a Reminders panel, the app will sync with your stock Reminders app and read you a list of things to do today.
* You can also add a Calendar panel, Twitter panel, and Birthday panel for $0.99 each, or $2.99 for all existing and future panels.

* You can select from five different alarm sounds, or select a song from your iPhone’s music library. So, you can wake up to whatever suits your mood.
* Summarise – Talking Alarm Clock is free. But, you may want to invest in the additional three bucks to get all current and future panel options. Don’t forget to add iDB to your morning news feed. Download it in the App Store today.
