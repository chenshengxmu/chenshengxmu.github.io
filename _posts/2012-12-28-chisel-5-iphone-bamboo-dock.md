* You love your iPhone 5 and pride yourself with being an environmentally conscious person? How about putting your money where your mouth is by considering this awesome-looking iPhone 5 dock from iSkelter? Handmade entirely from bamboo, one of the fastest-growing plants on Earth, it “perfectly compliments your iPhone’s minimalistic design features” with a touch of eco-friendliness. As the images attest, the dock will keep your iPhone 5 firmly in place either in portrait or landscape.
* As a nice touch, there’s even a carving elegantly leading the Lightning cable out, thus reducing incidences of tangled cords. I’m a big fan of Feng Shui and the minimalistic interior design so I’m already thinking how this could enrich my home office setup. I’ve got more shots and a video for you right past the break…
* The Chisel 5 Dock is handcrafted entirely from renewable bamboo.
* Here’s the blurb:
* The Chisel 5 iPhone dock keeps your iPhone propped up safely away from the piles of disaster on your desk. Use it to view videos if you like, or to simply add some eco-friendly and cool design to your workspace.
* Now, don’t you wave off bamboo just yet.
* In its natural form, bamboo in the Asian culture has traditionally been used as a construction material. It can be cut and laminated into sheets and planks and hold up simple suspension bridges.
* In Hong Kong, they use bamboo for skyscrapers and over in China they’ve been using it to make paper since early times, as well as distinct style furniture. And if you ever go to the Philippines, don’t be surprised to see houses made entirely of bamboo.
* Here’s a production video educating us on the laser engraving process.
* As seen in the photos, its smooth lines and clean design is simple yet brilliant.
* The properties of bamboo pulp are closer to softwood pulps, yielding the material its softer-than-standard-hardwood feel.

* What’s best, the dock isn’t prohibitively expensive as its exquisite appearance might suggest!
* It’s only $39, down from its original price of $50 apiece. If you have the iPhone 4/4S, iSkelter’s got you covered, too.
* Isn’t this the most beautiful iPhone dock you’ve ever seen?
