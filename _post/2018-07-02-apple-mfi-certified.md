* Typically, the best accessories for iPhone are those listed as Apple MFi Certified. To find out whether the iPhone accessory you want to buy is certified, read on.
* You can purchase cables and other accessories for your iPhone anywhere these days, including grocery stores, local gas stations, and even from vendors on the side of the streets. However, not all accessories are created equal.
* Apple’s MFi Program, known as Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad, is a licensing program for developers of hardware and software peripherals that work with Apple devices. When a company receives Apple MFi certification, it increases the likelihood that a product from that manufacturer lives up to Apple’s technical requirements.
* Unfortunately, not every product marked with an MFi label or marking is actually Apple MFi Certified. To be sure, you should consult with Apple’s official list of manufacturers and accessories that are included in the program.
* You can do this by doing a search on Apple’s official website. As the iPhone maker explains:
* Once an accessory has completed MFi self-certification requirements and is reported to Apple as sold/distributed by the manufacturer it will be searchable in our public database of authorized MFi accessories.
* Note: Just because an accessory is Apple MFi Certified, doesn’t mean it’s excellent. Instead, there’s just a guarantee that it lives up to Apple’s basic technical requirements.
* Besides looking for the accessory an Apple’s list, there’s another way to determine whether something is Apple MFi Certified. If the price is too good to be true, then it probably is.
* Where do you buy accessories for your iPhone and other Apple devices? Let us know below.
