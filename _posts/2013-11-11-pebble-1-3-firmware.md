* Pebble has had basic support for iOS Notifications in place from day one. The implementation, however, left a lot to be desired as the Pebble smarwatch could only relay the most basic of iOS notifications through a companion iPhone app.
* Eagle-eyed readers will remember that the company last week confirmed an upcoming update would enable additional iOS 7 Notification Center alerts.
* And just like clockwork, a new version of Pebble’s iOS app has gone live now in the App Store, introducing full integration with the iOS 7 Notification Center. This allows Pebble owners to receive any alerts enabled in Notification Center on an iOS 7 device and have them displayed on their $150 smartwatch.
* Yes, this includes alerts from third-party apps such as Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and lots more. Go past the fold for more…
* From iTunes release notes:
* Now get all your notifications. Pebble now supports the enhanced notification system in iOS 7 (for iPhone 4s devices and higher).
* Please refer to the help sections of the Pebble app and help.getpebble.com for information on how to manage notifications sent to your Pebble smartwatch from different iOS apps.
* You can now receive alerts from apps like Calendar, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Flickr, Dropbox, WhatsApp, Flipboard and just about any third-party app which supports the iOS 7 Notification Center.
* Previously, Notification Center alerts were limited to missed calls and text messages.
* And here’s a video of notifications in action:
* In addition to the refreshed app, Pebble has announced a much improved SDK 2.0 with four new APIs for Javascript, Accelerometer, Data Logging and Persistent Storage.
* Pebble Smartwatch app can be downloaded free from the App Store.
* The 11.4MB download requires an iDevice running iOS 7.0 or later.
* And of course, you’ll need a $150 Pebble smartwatch.
