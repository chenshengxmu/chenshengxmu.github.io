* Google’s native search app for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad today received a pretty significant update on the App Store, bringing the app to version 15.0.
* People who use an external keyboard with their iPad can now use time-saving shortcuts within the app to search faster and navigate the app more easily.
* Other improvements in this release of the Google app include busiest hours in search results and dynamic font sizing enhancements.
* The Google app is available free on the App Store.
* To see the list of supported keyboard shortcuts on Google 15.0 for iOS, simply press the Command (⌘) key on your external keyboard.
* As for the embedded business hours, the refreshed software now injects information on the busiest hours for places and local businesses directly into your search results page. As a result, you won’t have to tap and expand the local search result anymore.
* And for the aforementioned Accessibility improvement, the text within the app will now dynamically resize and shrink, depending on your accessibility font size setting in Settings → General → Accessibility → Larger Text.
* Download Google for iOS for free on the App Store.
