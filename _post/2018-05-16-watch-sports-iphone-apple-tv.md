* Under Watch Now:
* Regardless of platform, you can add your favorite teams to the TV app.
* By adding your favorites, games featuring those teams will go to the top of the listings under both the Watch Now and Sports tabs.
* When a sporting event is live, you’ll see live scores, when applicable, on both the Watch TV and Sports screens. This makes it simple to see how teams are doing in real-time.
* In the TV app, sports scores are on by default. If you’d rather not know the score, you can turn them off. On iOS, go into the Settings app under TV. On this page, turn off the toggle next to Show Sports Scores.
* Please note: Scores don’t show up for all sports.
* You can always find sports scores and content from your favorite teams on iOS and Apple TV. Whether you’re into the NFL, MLB, NBA, or something with fewer viewers like the LMX and WNBA, Apple’s TV app has you covered.
