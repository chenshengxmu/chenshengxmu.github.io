* Apple yesterday surprised fans by releasing a $40 Lightning dock for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus which works with official Apple cases. A $10 pricier than Apple’s previous docks, it can be used to listen to music and sync your device with a computer while charging your iPhone’s battery at the same time.
* What the spec sheet available on the Online Apple Store doesn’t tell you is that the dock requires iOS 8 or later for audio out. The requirement is listed in a support document for Apple’s Lightning docks, as noted by 9to5Mac.
* “You’ll need iOS 8 or later to use the iPhone Lightning Dock,” reads the support document. iOS 8 isn’t required for just charging non-iOS 8 devices.
* Jordan Kahn said on Twitter he has been able to confirm with Apple that the iOS 8 requirement is needed to support an Apple headset that includes a remote control.
* “When you plug headphones into the iPhone Lightning Dock, you can use the volume and playback controls built into the headphones,” notes Apple.

* The dock’s 3.5mm audio out port can be used to connect the dock to external speakers and amplifiers or your headphones.
* As mentioned before, the accessory works with Apple’s official cases, but several reviewers have noted that it’s compatible with a number of third-party cases, too, as long as they don’t have really thick bottoms.
* In addition to the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the charging dock supports iPads and can be used to dock a Lightning equipped iPod touch.
* It’s available via the Apple Online Store and ships in 1-3 days.
