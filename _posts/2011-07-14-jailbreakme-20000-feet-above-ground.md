* If you haven’t heard of JailbreakMe by now, you may be living under a rock. One thing you’re definitely not doing is flying in a plane, because a video has surfaced that shows an iPhone 4 being jailbroken with JailbreakMe.com from 20,000 up in the air.
* The cool thing about JailbreakMe is that it allows you to jailbreak an iDevice in Safari on the device itself. All you need is an internet connection and a few seconds to let Cydia install. And thanks to the availability of internet access on most commercial airlines, we bring you JailbreakMe on a plane…
* “TheVexenon” uploaded a video to his YouTube account of him jailbreaking his iPhone 4 with JailbreakMe 3.0. As you can see in the video, the process is very simple and straightforward, and TheVexenon’s iPhone 4 has jailbroken in under 30 seconds.
* Comex must be proud when he sees video demonstrations like this of his jailbreak tool. JailbreakMe is definitely the easiest method for jailbreaking there is, and it’s neat to see people jailbreaking from the sky!
* We’re going to make a challenge: Record yourself jailbreaking with JailbreakMe in creative and interesting places like this video. Then send us a link to that video on either our Twitter account or alex [at] iphonedownloadblog [dot] com. We want to see where you’re jailbreaking! Make sure it’s something creative! If it’s good enough, we may post it on the site.
