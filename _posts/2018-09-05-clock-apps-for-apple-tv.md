* Clock and Timer for Apple TV is another good option that offers a little more than the rest. The app lets you change four settings and gives you utility features like a timer and stopwatch.
* Clock and Timer shows a very basic background gradient with your local time and date. But, the added options for the world clock and utilities make up for it if you use them.

* Giving you the time with nixie tubes is, yep, Nixie Time. For something different in a clock display, this app provides the glowing orange from its wire mesh tubes and a cool reflection of it as well.
* While there may not be a bunch of standout features for the Nixie Time app, the display in itself is what makes it unique.
