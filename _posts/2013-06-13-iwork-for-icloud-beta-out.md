* Alongside OS X Mavericks and iOS 7, Apple showed off its new web-based ‘iWork for iCloud’ software suite during its Monday keynote. The suite, similar to Google Docs and Office 360, allows users to view and edit iWork, and other documents right from their browser. And Apple just activated a beta version of it for registered developers…
* iWork for iCloud exists totally in the cloud, meaning that it’s accessible via Safari, Internet Explorer and other browsers. The web-based app suite includes Pages, Numbers and Keynote, and editing and viewing documents in these apps looks and feels almost identical to their native counterparts—animations and other UI elements included.

* Registered developers can access the iWork for iCloud beta by visiting beta.icloud.com. If you’re not seeing the new apps, don’t worry, it looks like a lot of devs are still seeing the old iWork icons. Just check back later today. Unfortunately, it looks like those who aren’t developers are going to have to wait until the fall to access it.
