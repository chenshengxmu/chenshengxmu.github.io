* After peering into his crystal ball, Jefferies & Company analyst Peter Misek conjured up a major prediction for Apple’s rumored HD TV set which, according to Misek, will be announced during a keynote which will kick off Apple’s annual developers conference in San Francisco next Monday at 10am PT.
* Yes, this is the same guy who back in April said the iTV, as the media calls the rumored Apple-branded TV set, will be actually called the iPanel. We’ll leave it up to you to draw conclusions…
* As relayed yesterday by Boy Genius Report, Misek’s note to clients claims Apple will only introduce the product at WWDC, putting it on sale in the second half of 2012. He also wrote that carriers AT&T, Verizon, Rogers, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom are testing iTVs in their labs.
* Granted, this isn’t the craziest iTV prediction we’ve heard from analysts so far.
* Realistically, we probably won’t see the iTV before 2014.
* The same publication also reported that Apple will announce a near feature-complete version of the much-improved Apple TV operating system said to power Apple’s television set.
* BGR’s track record concerning Apple reporting is a mixed bag of misses and hits.
* Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster has been the most outspoken proponent of an Apple-branded TV set, recently claiming that the iTV is not a question of ‘when’ rather than ‘if’. He, however, speculated Apple will announce the iTV in December and release it six months later.
* People are expecting all sorts of things from Apple’s television set, from jaw-dropping industrial design to apps and games to becoming the iHub for all your home entertainment needs.
* If such a product is to hit the market soon, what do you think the most-requested feature would be?
