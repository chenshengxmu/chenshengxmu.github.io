* Instagram is testing a new feature with a small subset of its users that may eventually permit its customers to follow hashtags on the service, like they would other people.
* As first spotted by Twitter user @Social_pip and relayed by The Next Web, following a hashtag lets you see “top posts and recent stories” labeled with that hashtag without having to follow the account holders.
* I’ve been waiting for this for a long time.
* I use Instagram every day and have always wanted to follow specific hashtags that interest me, like #apple, #iphone and #calisthenics, but couldn’t because Instagram inexplicably doesn’t support this yet.
* The feature appears to be a limited test for now and The Next Web doesn’t clarify when Instagram might be planning to roll this out to everyone, but the sooner the better.
* Are you excited about this upcoming Instagram feature?
