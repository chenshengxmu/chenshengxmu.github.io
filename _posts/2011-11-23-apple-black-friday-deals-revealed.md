* Yesterday, we started seeing Black Friday banners pop up on Apple.com. The top of the image read “Every gift list has its day,” and was followed by a request for customers to return to Apple’s online store on November 25th for a special one-day shopping event.
* Given Apple’s track record, we weren’t expecting the kind of deep discounts that other retailers will be offering this week. And it looks like we were spot on. 9to5Mac has gotten ahold of a copy of Apple’s Black Friday deals, and as last year, they seem fairly modest…

* Aside from knocking $101 off of each of its Mac computers, Apple is also shaving between $41 and $61 off of its iPads, depending on the model. The iPod touch is also being discounted according to capacity, with savings between $21 and $41.
* Those with accessories left on their shopping lists will be happy to hear that Apple is also discounting its in-house supplements this Friday. Items like the Mophie Juice Pack Air and the iPad-compatible wireless keyboard will be receiving various price cuts.
* Although the sale may not seem like much, you have to consider that Apple doesn’t typically discount its current-generation products. And if you are looking to snag an iPad or an iPod touch before the holidays, this is likely the cheapest price you’re going to find.
* Do you plan on doing any shopping at Apple on Friday?
