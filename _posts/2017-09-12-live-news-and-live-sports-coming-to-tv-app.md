* Apple TV got the TV app, alongside iPhones and iPads last year. It allows you to easily discover new content to watch, or pickup where you left off. The biggest downside was that it didnâ€™t have access to live TV streams, instead of having to launch apps individually. Apple changes this with the new Apple TV 4K.
* Now, live news and sports will automatically show up from 3rd party apps, inside of the TV Watch app. Sports like NBA and MLB, as well as breaking news from apps like Bloomberg, CNN, and others are easier to access than finding them individually.
* You will also receive notifications when your favorite teams games start.
* This is just one of a few new features coming to the new Apple TV. Also be sure to check out everything new coming in tvOS 11.
* Be sure to keep your eye on iDownloadBlog and the iDB YouTube channel for everything new coming to Apple TV.
