* Apple has seeded the first OS X 10.9.3 to registered Mac developers this evening. The release comes just a week after Apple released OS X 10.9.2 with fixes for SSL bug, Mail and FaceTime audio.
* The new beta build is available to registered Mac developers through the Software Update tab in the Mac App Store, or as a full download via the Mac section of Apple’s online developer portal…

* There’s no word so far on what changes we should expect to see in the new version of Mavericks, but Apple has asked developers to specifically focus on graphic drivers and audio in today’s beta.
* OS X 10.9.2, released last Tuesday, featured a number of bug fixes and other improvements. Today’s build is labeled as 13D12, and we’ll be sure to let you know if it includes anything new of note.
* Update: enhancements have been discovered in the beta for 4K display users. Click here for more.
