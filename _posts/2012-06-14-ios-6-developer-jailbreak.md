* Indeed, there will be a jailbreak for iOS 6 in the very near future, but it might not be what you’re expecting. This morning, MuscleNerd announced that the iPhone Dev Team will release an iOS 6 jailbreak “In the spirit of the experimental ecosystem JBers provide”.
* With that in mind, the team is releasing a developer only jailbreak for iOS 6. This means that you won’t have access to a pretty interface like Cydia, but you will be provided with SSH access.
* In the spirit of the “experimental ecosystem” JBers provide, we’re releasing a DEVELOPER-only tethered JB for iOS6 (no Cydia, just SSH)

* Since iOS 6 and this jailbreak is intended for developers only, this makes sense. If you’re a new developer, though, you may have some questions as to how to use the upcoming jailbreak. We hope to be able to answer those in an upcoming tutorial that showcases how to use the new iOS 6 jailbreak.
* Are you a developer? Are you excited about the prospects of a jailbroken iOS 6 installation? Stay tuned.
