* Good news today for all of you travelers out there, especially those in the Delta camp. The major US airline has just released a new iPad app and updated its iPhone app with Passbook support, iPhone 5 support and other improvements.
* On the new iPad app, you can find, compare and book flights, and their are dozens of other useful features. And with the updated iPhone app, you can now take advantage of Apple’s new Passbook app to store your boarding pass, and more…
* The iPad app is actually pretty cool. On top of all of the flight management features, it also has interactive in-flight features and a 3D globe you can spin to see all of the available Delta flights around the world. Here’s a video demo (via Cult of Mac):
