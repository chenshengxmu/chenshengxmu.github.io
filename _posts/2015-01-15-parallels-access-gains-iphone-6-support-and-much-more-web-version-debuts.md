* Parallels Access, a native iOS and Android app for remotely accessing your applications and files residing on Windows or Mac PCs, is now available as a web-based software that anyone can use on any computing device with a standard web browser.
* In addition, the iOS edition of Parallels Access has received a fairly significant version 2.5 update today that brings out many enhancements such as full support for the native display sizes on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, a full-blown file manager, improved audio control settings and much more.
* In addition to iOS 8-specific additions like the Document Picker extension allowing you to copy and view files from other apps in Parallels Access and the ability to Share files using iOS 8’s multi-purpose Share sheet, a much-improved file manager makes managing your files a lot easier.
