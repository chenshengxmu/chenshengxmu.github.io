* We learned in January that Apple would be opening its first European iOS App Development Center in Italy and now German website Macerkopf.de notes that the Università di Napoli Federico II in Naples has officially confirmed partnering with Apple on the initiative.
* Beginning in October 2016, the upcoming iOS App Development Center will let Naples university students take part in a nine month curriculum which was designed by Apple itself.
* A dedicated facility at the new Campus in San Giovanni a Teduccio, a coastal suburb east of Naples, includes labs and access to the latest Apple hardware and software.
* “We are thrilled to be working with Universita’ di Napoli Federico II to launch the first iOS Developer Academy in Europe,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO.
* ”Some of the most creative developers in the world come from Europe, and we are confident this center will help the next generation get the skills they need for success.”
* Students can apply at the University of Naples website. Teachers for the Academy can apply as well.
* In announcing the initiative in January 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that “The phenomenal success of the App Store is one of the driving forces behind the more than 1.4 million jobs Apple has created in Europe,” adding Apple would be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success.
