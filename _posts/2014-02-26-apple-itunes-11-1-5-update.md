* Apple has released an update for iTunes this afternoon, bringing the software to version 11.1.5. Don’t get too excited though, it appears to just be a maintenance release with only a handful of improvements.
* Those improvements include a fix for a problem that may have been causing iTunes to quit unexpectedly when a device is connected, as well as better compatibility with iBooks for users on OS X Mavericks…
* Here’s the tiny change log:
* – This update fixes a problem that may cause iTunes to quit unexpectedly when a device is connected and improves compatibility with iBooks for Mac on OS X Mavericks. 
* Folks looking to grab the latest version of iTunes can find it either via the Mac App Store’s ‘Updates’ tab (unsurprisingly, the update comes in at just 81.4MB), or you can find a direct link on our Downloads page.
