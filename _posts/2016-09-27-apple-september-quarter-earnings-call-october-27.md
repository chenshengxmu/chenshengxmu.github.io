* Apple said on the Investor webpage that it has scheduled an earnings call to discuss fiscal 2016 fourth quarter earnings a month from today on Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 2:00pm PT / 5:00pm ET. The company’s fourth fiscal quarter corresponds to the third calendar quarter. A press release will go out 30 minutes in advance of the earnings call.
* The earnings call will include early sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.
* As is its wont, Apple will not break down iPhone sales by model. Apple also said it would be no longer providing opening weekend iPhone sales going forward.
* Don’t keep your fingers crossed for Apple Watch numbers either: the Cupertino firm lumps wearable sales together with sales of the Apple TV, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories in the “Other Products” category.
* The company will allow anyone to listen to the conference call live via its website. A replay stream will be available for a few weeks.
* Live streaming uses Apple’s HTTP Live Streaming technology, which requires an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with Safari on iOS 7.0 or later, a Mac with Safari 6.0.5 or later on OS X v10.8.5 or later or a PC with Microsoft Edge on Windows 10.
* Apple’s guidance for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter calls for the revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion, gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38 percent and operating expenses between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion.
