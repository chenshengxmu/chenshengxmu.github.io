* Apple’s second-generation iPhone SE is reportedly rumored to feature an all-glass back, indicating for the first time that this affordable Apple handset might potentially support wireless charging features compatible with the Qi standard.
* According to a sketchy rumor published Monday on tekz24.com, “a very reliable source” told author Sachin Bhatt that the new iPhone SE—let’s call it iPhone SE 2—will feature a glass back panel just like the iPhone 8 series and iPhone X.
* “The source also told us that the upgraded iPhone SE might support wireless charging and hence the implementation of glass back makes a lot of sense,” reads the article.
* iPhone SE is Apple’s most affordable handset.
* Featuring Apple’s A9 chip and the 12-megapixel camera with 4K video capture, iPhone SE basically offers iPhone 6s-class hardware in a more compact package, sans 3D Touch.
* iPhone SE 2, according to a recent report from Chinese-language Economic Daily News, may arrive in the first quarter of 2018.
* The upgraded handset should sport Apple’s A10 Fusion chip with 2GB RAM, a display size between four and 4.2 inches, a 1,700mAh battery, a twelve-megapixel rear shooter and a five-megapixel front camera. It’s believed to come in 32GB and 128GB capacities and retail for around 25,000 rupees in India, which works out to about $400 in the US.
