* iH8sn0w has released a significant update to his popular jailbreak utility sn0wbreeze tonight, bringing the software to version 2.9.8. The update includes several improvements, as well as support for the new iOS 6.x untethered jailbreak.
* As you know, the evad3rs released evasi0n yesterday for both Windows and Mac platforms. And that should handle most of your jailbreaking needs. But for those of you looking to try something different, you might give sn0wbreeze a shot…
* Of course, sn0wbreeze has a few caveats. For one, it’s a Windows-only utility. And it only works with older devices. But if you happen to fall into both of those categories, the app is actually pretty powerful. Here are the 2.9.8 release notes:
* I should note AppleTV 2 stuff such as XBMC is currently broken. So you may want to hold back on updating until your favorite tweaks are updated and available.
* As stated many times in the past, sn0wbreeze cannot be updated to work on A5(X)/A6(X) devices until a low level exploit in DFU or iBoot is found and made public.
* For those running A5(X)/A6(X) devices and need to preserve your baseband, there is nothing you can do at the moment. For those wanting to hacktivate, the only advice I can give is to buy the carrier’s SIM (the one its locked to obviously) on ebay. The SIM does not have to be activated with the carrier to activate the phone.
* It’s also worth noting that iH8sn0w has updated f0recast for both Windows and Mac as well, to support the latest scenarios. The app can tell you if your device is jailbreakable or not, and also shows you your available SHSH blobs stored on Cydia.
* As usual, you can find the latest versions of sn0wbreeze and f0recast on our Downloads page. If you’re an expert, feel free to dive right in. Otherwise, if you’re looking for help, I imagine it won’t be too long before Jeff comes around with a how-to video.
