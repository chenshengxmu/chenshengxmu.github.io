* Zane Lowe, who used to be a host for BBC Radio for many years before moving to Beats 1 and Apple Music more than a year ago, has been announced as a keynote speaker for 2017’s South by Southwest (SXSW) music and film festival, Billboard reported Monday.
* In addition to a keynote speech from Lowe, the annual confab in Austin will include keynotes from “Rogue One” filmmaker Gareth Edwards, author Adam Grant and Mount Everest photographer and climber Cory Richards.
* Among the 750+ panels to be held at 2017 SXSW is one titled “Does Spotify Help More Than It Hurts?”
* Other music-related panels include “Saving Small Venues & The Independent Music Scene”—featuring Eventbrite’s Greg Patterson and Brooklyn Bowl’s Peter Shapiro—and “The Jazz of the Music Biz,” featuring Talib Kweli, Jarret Myer and others about where jazz and avant-garde music fit into their creative philosophies.
* Hugh Forrest, Chief Programming Officer for SXSW:
* The programming announced today reflects a lot of the bigger-picture trends we think will be getting the most buzz in March 2017.
* These trends include innovation in the transportation space, the rise of artificial intelligence, more emphasis on innovation within healthcare, and an increase in creative industry inclusion.
* Previously confirmed keynotes and featured speakers include filmmaker Lee Daniels, Transparent creator Jill Soloway, geneticist Jennifer Doudna, Pussy Riot member Nadya Tolokonnikova and NBA icon Magic Johnson.
* According to SXSW’s official media release, additional keynotes, featured speakers and sessions will be announced in the coming months.
* Lowe, boring in New Zealand, is now the Creative Director and LA Anchor for Beats 1, Apple’s first free global radio station broadcasting 24/7 to over 100 countries.
* SXSW is scheduled to run from March 10 through March 19, 2017.
