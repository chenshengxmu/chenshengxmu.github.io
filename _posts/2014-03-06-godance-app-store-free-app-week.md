* It’s Thursday and those who frequent iDownloadBlog know what that means as the App Store editors get to chose a new app to go free for the next seven days.
* After slashing Tiny Firefighters to zero bucks last Thursday, that interactive app/book/game for kids has now gone back up to its regular asking price of $2.99. Not to worry – Apple’s already named Sega’s Go Dance the App Store’s new App of the Week.
* Launched last September and normally selling for $1.99, Go Dance was named one of the App Store’s Best Of 2013 games and it’s easy to see why: the game uses advanced motion-capture tech to turn your device’s FaceTime camera into a motion sensor of sorts that picks up your movements while imitating avatars dance on screen.
* Movements are recognized and scored in real-time and you really have to see it for yourself to fully appreciate the effect. What are you waiting for? Hit the App Store and grab your free copy of Go Dance now, go, go, go!
* Here’s from Sega:
* Featuring chart topping tracks from LMFAO, Avicii, Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, Flo Rida and more, Go Dance gives players the freedom to dance, share and compete with friends around the world, anytime and anywhere.
* Utilizing Extreme Reality motion-capture technology by XTR to turn the FaceTime Camera into a motion-sensor, Go Dance players can improve their dancing skills on the go as movements are captured and scored in real-time.
* And here’s your launch trailer.
* Real motion-based dancing has never been more fun!

* Of course, you can customize your avatars and backgrounds and Sega promised it will be adding new avatars, music tracks from the likes of Lady GaGa and others, as well as other goodies via upcoming content updates.

* You’re advised to stand your device on a table, desk or other flat surface to fully enjoy the game. For the best experience, connect your iPhone or iPad to your television via a HDMI cable or just use AirPlay to beam action wirelessly to the TV.
* Strike a pose using the FaceTime camera and racket up that score!
* Go Dance is available free in the App Store until next Thursday.
* The universal binary download comes in at 85.3MB.
* The game is compatible with an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 6.0 or later.
