* Apple this morning shared a pair of new commercials through its official YouTube channel. Titled “Creek” and “Soul Mate,” the 30-second videos focus on depth of field photography made possible by the dual-lens system on iPhone 7 Plus and the accompanying Portrait shooting mode in the stock Camera application.
* Be sure to watch the new ads and tell us how you liked them in comments.
* “When you shoot in Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus, your subject stands out from the background,” proclaims the voiceover.
* “So a photo of your kid in a creek becomes a portrait of youth in nature. Fine? Fine art.”
* Here’s that ad.
* “When you shoot in Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus, your subject stands out from the background,” says another ad. “That’s the difference between a photo of your dog and one of your best friend. Housemate? Soul mate.”
