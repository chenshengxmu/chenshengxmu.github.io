* BootSound is a recently released jailbreak tweak with one simple premise—it brings the iconic Mac OS X boot-up sound to the iPhone. BootSound is a tweak with no options or settings to configure. Once you install it, any respiring or reboot will cause the OS X start-up sound to play via the device’s speakers.
* If you’re looking for a way to further customize your iPhone, then BootSound is a good place to start. Have a look at our video walkthrough inside to see what it all entails.
* As mentioned, there are no options or settings to configure for BootSound; it’s an install and go experience. I do think it would be nice if the developer at least allowed users to disable the boot sound, or adjust the volume. As it stands, BootSound is a decent jailbreak tweak, but I think it needs a few options for customizing the experience.
* If you’d like to take BootSound for a test drive, then head over to Cydia’s ModMyi repo where it can be downloaded without cost. As always, be sure to share your thoughts about the tweak down below.
