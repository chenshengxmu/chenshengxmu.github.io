* Apple announced Sunday night in a press release that the company has added UnionPay as a payment option for the App Store in China. Having issued over 4.5 billion UnionPay cards to date both in China and abroad, China UnionPay is the major bankcard network in the People’s Republic. According to the press release, UnionPay customers will be able to easily link their Apple ID with a UnionPay debit or credit card for one-tap purchases. 
* “The ability to buy apps and make purchases using UnionPay cards has been one of the most requested features from our customers in China,” said Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue,. “China is already our second largest market for app downloads, and now we’re providing users with an incredibly convenient way to purchase their favorite apps with just one-tap.”
* Earlier this year, rumors started surfacing claiming that Apple had reached a deal with China UnionPay that would presumably  allow users to make payment with what we now know as Apple Pay. Of course, this hasn’t materialized quite yet, but with Apple now adding UnionPay as a payment option for the App Store, it gives those rumors much more legs.
