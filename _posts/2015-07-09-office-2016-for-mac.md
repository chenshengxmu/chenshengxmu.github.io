* Microsoft on Thursday announced the release of Office 2016 for Mac. This marks the first major Mac release of the popular software suite since Office 2011, and it’s now available for download in 140 countries, for Office 365 subscribers.
* “Unmistakably Office, designed for Mac,” said Kirk Koenigsbauer, corporate VP of Office Client Applications and Services. It includes new versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote, as well as a number of improvements.
* Among those improvements are full Retina support, Full Screen view and Multi-Touch gestures. Office 2016 also features deeper cloud integration, allowing you to get to your documents on all your devices and pick up where you left off.
* Here are some screenshots:
