* One of the biggest public concerns regarding the Apple Watch seems to be its battery life. While other smartwatches, such as the Pebble, claim life of up to 10 days, the Cupertino wearable is said to last for less than 24 hours.
* But John Arrow and ex-Nike staffer Lane Musgrave are looking to change that with the ‘Reserve Strap.’ It features embedded lithium polymer cells and an inductive charging cradle to keep your Apple Watch going strong.
* Since the Watch hasn’t officially launched yet, the Reserve Strap isn’t a real product yet. It’s currently in the prototype stage, and the team is still trying to iron out details, such as how long the band will extend battery life.
* They have submitted patents for their band though, and are already accepting pre-orders, so clearly this is more than just a concept. The current price is $249, but they mention that could change hinging on market interest.
* Unveiled in September, the Apple Watch will launch next month with a starting price of $349. It’s rumored that the device features a hidden port for diagnostics, which would open the doors for even more band accessories.
* We’re expecting to learn a lot more about Apple Watch at the media event on Monday.
