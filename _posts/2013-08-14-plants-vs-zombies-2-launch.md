* At this point, it seems like we’ve been waiting on ‘Plants vs. Zombies 2’ for forever now. First previewed back in March of this year, the sequel to PopCap’s popular tower defense game was supposed to launch in July, but was delayed until ‘late summer.’
* Then a few weeks ago, the title was soft-launched in two countries: Australia and New Zealand, with no explanation when we would see the title stateside. But never fear, the wait is over. ‘Plants vs. Zombies 2: It’s About Time’ just hit App Stores worldwide…
* From the App Store’s description:
* “The zombies are coming… back. It’s about time! The sequel to the hit action-strategy adventure with over 30 Game of the Year awards is here. Join Crazy Dave on a crazy adventure where you’ll meet, greet and defeat legions of zombies from the dawn of time to the end of days. Amass an army of powerful new plants, super charge them with Plant Food and power up your defenses with amazing new ways to protect your brain.”
* And here’s your official PvZ trailer:
* As you can see, the game has virtually been rebuilt from the ground up and there’s new plant food and power-ups, new levels and new zombies. It also takes advantage of newer technologies, like cloud saving, which lets you sync and save across multiple devices.
* You’ll also notice that the title is now a freemium app, meaning it’s free to download and play, but at some point or another you’ll be encouraged to make in-app purchases. The developers say, though, that everything in the game can be unlocked via gameplay.
* Speaking of gameplay, here’s a clip:
* If you’re interested, you can grab ‘Plants vs. Zombies 2: It’s About Time’ from the App Store. It’s universal, meaning it works on both the iPhone and iPad, and of course it’s free.
