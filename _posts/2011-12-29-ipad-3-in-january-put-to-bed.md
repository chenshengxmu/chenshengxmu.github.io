* At iDB, we don’t just pass along the Apple rumors; we also try to follow them on their road to either truth or debunking. And in the case of the recent Digitimes’ iPad 3 report, that journey took less than 24 hours.
* Yesterday we told you about Digitimes’ latest claim that Apple would unveil two new iPad models at the Macworld (now iWorld) conference in January. But today, Jim Dalrymple of The Loop has effectively put that rumor to bed.
* For those who aren’t familiar with Dalrymple, he’s the former Editor at Large of Macworld with a history of breaking Apple news. When he weighs in on a rumor, folks tend to pay attention.
* From The Loop:
* “Reports began circulating earlier today that Apple would release two new iPads at Macworld Expo in January. These rumors are completely false. I checked with a number of my sources today and an iPad 3 is not planned for release at Macworld. In case you’re wondering, an iPad 3 won’t be released at CES either.”
* We were skeptical of Digitimes’ report from the get-go, and this seems to confirm our suspicions. For what it’s worth, Jim also notes that Apple won’t be debuting its rumored TV set in January, either. But he doesn’t exactly deny that it exists.
