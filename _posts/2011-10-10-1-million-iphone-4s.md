* Apple has confirmed that iPhone 4S pre-orders topped 1 million units sold in the first 24 hours of availability. This number places the iPhone 4S as the most pre-ordered product in Apple’s history.
* The iPhone 4 saw 600,000 pre-orders on its first day. Apple’s newest smartphone is on track to become the best-selling iPhone ever…
* “We are blown away with the incredible customer response to iPhone 4S,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “The first day pre-orders for iPhone 4S have been the most for any new product that Apple has ever launched and we are thrilled that customers love iPhone 4S as much as we do.”
* AT&T alone accounted for 200,000 4S pre-orders in the first 24 hours.
* Customers can still pre-order the iPhone 4S, but shipping estimates have now slipped to 1-2 weeks. Those that were lucky enough to get their pre-orders in early will have the iPhone 4S delivered from Apple on October 14th.
