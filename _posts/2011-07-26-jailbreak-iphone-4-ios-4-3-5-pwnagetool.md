* Apple recently released iOS 4.3.5 to patch a few security vulnerabilities, and RedSn0w has already been confirmed to offer a tethered jailbreak on Apple’s latest firmware.
* If you’re on an iPhone 4 with an unlocked baseband, jailbreaking iOS 4.3.5 with RedSn0w will not preserve your baseband. Luckily, a custom build of PwnageTool has been released to fix that problem.
* The folks at Redmond Pie have put together a custom PwnageTool bundle for the iPhone 4 that will jailbreak iOS 4.3.5 and preserve an already-unlocked baseband. Newer basebands do not receive an unlock.
* You’ll need iOS 4.3.5, iTunes 10.4, a tetheredboot utility, and PwnageTool 4.33, which you can find in our downloads section. (PwnageTool is Mac-only software.) To learn how to jailbreak with PwnageTool, refer to our tutorial.
* To get the custom build of PwnageTool that you’ll need to keep your iPhone 4’s unlock, head over to Redmond Pie and download their custom build package. They have a guide on how to modify PwnageTool with the custom build, too.
* It’s recommend that all jailbreakers stay on iOS 4.3.3 for the most up-to-date untethered jailbreak. You can jailbreak all iDevices on 4.3.3 with JailbreakMe.
* Let us know if you decide to use PwnageTool on iOS 4.3.5. Or are you staying on 4.3.3 to keep your unlock?
