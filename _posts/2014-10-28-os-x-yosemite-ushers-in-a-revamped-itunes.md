* iTunes has been redesigned completely to coincide with OS X Yosemite’s design enhancements. The result is a much flatter and cleaner looking app that’s devoid of many of the shadows and layers present in previous iterations.
* Just recently, the iTunes Store, which resides within the iTunes app, received an update to match the flatter appearance. This has resulted in a more consistent look across the entire app.
* Check out our video walkthrough after the break, which highlights some of the changes in the latest version of iTunes— iTunes 12.
* Much of the functionality has remained more of less the same for iTunes—although there is a new tray for recent media items.  If you’re expecting vast functionality changes, you may be disappointed. As far as looks go, however, iTunes 12 matches OS X Yosemite well, and it’s one of the better looking redesigns of the app that I’ve seen over the years.
* What do you think about iTunes 12’s revamped visuals?
