* Coming into Boxing Day, developer Jonathan Levin is clearly fighting fit, with his second jailbreak tool in as many days. After a tvOS 11 update to his LiberTV jailbreak yesterday, today we have an iOS 11 tool, dubbed LiberiOS.
* This initial release is intended for more advanced users only, as it does not yet bundle Cydia. The popular package manager, or more specifically Cydia Substrate which it leverages to inject tweaks, is not yet updated to deal with the new techniques in the iOS 11 jailbreak. LiberiOS also does not yet include offsets for all devices and firmwares, with some of the earlier iOS 11 versions unsupported. If you’d like to accelerate the process of supporting your device, Levin has provided instructions on how to help him add compatibility.
* The first version of LiberiOS can be downloaded from the official page now; do not download it from, nor host it, elsewhere. I advise you read the page before using the tool, as it answers many questions you may have, outlines hazards, and includes the developer’s future intent, for example:
* “Code injection/tweaks/Cydia WILL be supported. But only when I’m certain it’s a stable jailbreak, and not failbreak material… Happy Holidays! And no, we’re not done yet. More to come. Just not now.”
* Using LiberiOS follows the same procedure as all recent jailbreaks. Install the official .ipa via Cydia Impactor from a computer, trust the app in Settings on your device, then run the app and hit Do It.
* Once all offsets are added LiberiOS should support all 64-bit devices, including the iPhone 8 (Plus) and X, on firmwares from iOS 11.0-11.1.2. Do not request support for iOS 11.2 or higher, as it won’t be possible with this set of bugs. Similarly, do not harass the developer for Cydia support. This cannot be provided by anyone except Saurik, who is already working on it.
* Early reports suggest that apart from missing offsets and lack of Cydia the tool has an excellent success rate, though more users will provide a clearer picture of its stability. If you feel comfortable giving it a try, I’d be interested to know your experiences. If you’re not comfortable using SSH and fixing any problems you may have, I’d recommend sitting it out for a few days until a more complete version is released.
* Happy Holidays, and good luck!
