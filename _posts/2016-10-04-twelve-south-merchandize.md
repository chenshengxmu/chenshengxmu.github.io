* Do you remember what your Mac smelled like the first time you unboxed it? If not, Apple-exclusive accessory maker Twelve South has you covered with a hand poured soy wax candle that delivers a “new Mac” smell to your nose. “We took that scent—and literally bottled it,” wrote the company. The candle is part of Twelve South’s line of merchandize that includes Mac-style T-shirts, hats, mugs and more.
* “We would do anything to make our customers happy, so when you asked to get your hands on the one-of-a-kind merchandise that we have created over the years, we listened,” wrote Twelve South.
* Believe it or not, the candle achieves the smell of a freshly unboxed Mac through a combination of notes of mint, peach, basil, lavender, mandarin and sage.
* The merchandize lineup includes a double vacuum wall insulated water bottle designed to keep your drinks cold for 24+ hours. The $34 bottle was created in partnership with the team at Miir.

* Then there’s a range of Mac-themed iDrink coolers that keep your drinks chilled.
* The $19 set includes six different Mac-themed sayings and each sports collapsible neoprene for “take-along to the beach, boat or barbecue”.

* If you prefer a cup of coffee to get your day started, Twelve South has you covered with a 14oz ceramic coffee mug, aptly named Power Up and available in Apple’s signature white and Twelve South’s red.

* And lastly, my favorite piece of merchandize—a $29 Quit Starring T-shirt, made from sixty percent cotton and forty percent polyester.
