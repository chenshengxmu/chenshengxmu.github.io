* iPhone manufacturer Foxconn is giving bonuses to employees in an effort to maintain workforce ahead of the iPhone 7 introduction, trade publication DigiTimes quoted Taiwanese media as saying this morning. The contract manufacturer has reportedly been “encouraging internal recommendations” by treating each employee who recommends qualified workers to a cash bonus of up to CNY1,400, or about $209.
* The goal of the project is to ensure a sufficient number of workers on Foxconn’s iPhone production lines, according to a Chinese-language Economic Daily News (EDN) report quoted by DigiTimes.
* “In addition, Foxconn has also been giving bonuses to workers for their first three months and to ex-workers that return to work,” the paper added.
