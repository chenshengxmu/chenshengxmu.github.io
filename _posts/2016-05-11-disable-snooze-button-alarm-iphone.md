* Having the ability to snooze when your alarm rings has probably saved millions of people from getting to work late, but I personally find it to be an annoying feature. When my alarm rings, I just don’t want to snooze and fall back half asleep, only to be reminded nine minutes later that it’s really time to wake up when the alarm rings again.
* Up until recently, I hadn’t realized you can actually disable the Snooze button altogether. Granted, I don’t use alarms very often, which is probably why I never noticed this option was right there in front of me. If you’re anything like me and want to disable the Snooze option from your alarms, then read on.
* Turning off snoozing is actually very obvious, but for those of you who might have missed the option, here is what you can do.
* When creating a new alarm, or when editing an existing one, simply turn off the Snooze option, as seen on this screenshot, then save the alarm.

* When your alarm rings in the morning, you won’t have the Snooze option available any longer. Instead, you will just be able to stop the alarm.
* I find this to be a better and less annoying set up, but your mileage may vary greatly. If you’re the kind of person who takes forever to get out of bed when the alarm rings, you probably want to keep the Snooze option on.
