* As if this wasn’t already enough, Skype has further removed the veil concerning its pending announcement at January’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
* In what can only be described as an Apple-esque marketing approach, Skype video chat looks destined to make the jump outside of the desktop and into the mobile platform. The only question remaining is, which platforms will it jump to?

* The website makes the statement; “I wish I could share moments like these“, accompanied by 17 different videos featuring every day situations. The videos emphasize connecting friends and family outside of the desktop-space, on the go, in a mobile environment.
* It’s all very reminiscent of Apple’s FaceTime promotions at the launch of the iPhone 4. Whether or not the announcements will include Android or other platforms is anyone’s guess, but we’d surely welcome as many people to the party as possible.
* Is Skype’s marketing campaign getting you excited?
