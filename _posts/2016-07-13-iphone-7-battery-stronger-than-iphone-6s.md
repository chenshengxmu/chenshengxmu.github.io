* A sketchy Weibo post claimed two months ago that the next iPhone would arrive outfitted with a slightly stronger battery than the iPhone 6s. Today, prolific leakster OnLeaks gave us a more specific information as to precisely how bigger the iPhone 7’s battery might be in comparison to the current iPhone 6s/Plus and previous-generation iPhone 6/Plus.
* According to his Twitter post, the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 will have a 1,960 mAh battery, comparing very favorably in terms of sheer specs to both the 1,715 mAh package found in the iPhone 6s and the 1,810 mAh battery in the previous-generation iPhone 6.
* A bigger battery in most cases results in a longer run time before the handset needs to be connected to power. Having a fourteen percent bigger battery than the iPhone 6s should help the iPhone 7 squeeze out an additional hour of run time.
* That’s without factoring in other power savings stemming from an Apple-designed, power-sipping ‘A10’ system-on-a-chip, fewer chips on the iPhone 7 logic board and software-related optimizations.
* Pretty reliable (not 100% but almost…) source told me #iPhone7 battery = 1960mAh (#iPhone6s = 1715mAh)

* In terms of the numbers, you’re looking at the following:
* Take this story with a grain of salt—the leakster cautions that he couldn’t guarantee that the information was 100 percent accurate despite receiving it from a trusted source.
* I wonder if this iPhone 7 battery increase is a result of the removal of the headphone jack, which takes a lot more space inside the device than most people imagine.
