* Shipping estimates for the Apple TV slipped to 1-2 weeks on the US Apple Online Store today, further fueling rumors that Apple is getting ready to refresh the device. In March, BuzzFeed reported that the company is planning to unveil a new, slimmer set-top box at WWDC in June.
* It’s worth noting that some users have reported that the device is showing “in stock” for them online today, but at Check Out many are still seeing later ship times. Regardless, the fluctuation in available stock is consistent with inventory behavior of past Apple products ahead of refreshes.
* Also adding to the consensus that Apple is about to update the set-top box is the company’s move to lower the price of the current model. In March, Tim Cook kicked off the Apple Watch event by announcing an exclusive deal with HBO and the lowering of the ATV’s price tag from $99 to $69.
* A new Apple TV has been believed to be on the verge of release for several months now, as the current model hasn’t been updated in 3 years, and is showing its age against competitors’ offerings. Among the features rumored for the new device are voice search and a TV-friendly App Store.
* WWDC is scheduled to begin on June 8, and Apple is also expected to talk about iOS 9, OS X 10.11, and a revamped Beats Music service.
