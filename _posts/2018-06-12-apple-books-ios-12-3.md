* On Tuesday, Apple offered more information on the iOS 12 Apple Books app that arrives this fall. First announced at last week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the refreshed app replaces iBooks on both iPhone and iPad. 
* Noting that Apple Books puts together books and audiobooks for the first time, Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software & Services, explains:
