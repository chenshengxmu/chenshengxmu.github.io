* With all due respect for Samuel L. Jackson, I think we can agree that this latest commercial is a tad easier on the eyes.
* That’s because the star of said commercial is non other than New Girl leading lady, and hipster heartstring puller, Zooey Deschanel.
* It’s the second iPhone 4S/Siri ad uncovered today staring some of Hollywood’s finest, but likely not the last…
* Sorry about the video quality, it was apparently captured from a television set.
* I’m not sure what to think about these commercials. I mean, they definitely show the real world aspect of using Siri on an iPhone 4S, but they kind of lack the polish that we’re used to.
* What do you think? And which commercial do you like better?
