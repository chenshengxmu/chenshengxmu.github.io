* Not even a day after updating RedSn0w, the Dev Team has pushed yet another update to the jailbreak tool, with the release of RedSn0w 0.9.9 beta 3. This update brings better compatibility with the iOS 5 GM.
* The latest version of RedSn0w can jailbreak iOS 5 GM on all devices except the iPad 2, but remember it is a tethered jailbreak, and it can be quite inconvenient…
* This newer version of RedSn0w also hides a nice perk for Windows users:
* “Update #11: redsn0w has been updated to 0.9.9b3 to auto-detect iOS5 GM firmware.  Remember:  it’s still tethered for all devices except for iPhone 3GS with old bootrom.  If you don’t use redsn0w to “Just boot” at power up, all jailbreak apps  (and even some native ones like MobileSafari) will fail to launch.
* If you already jailbroke the GM by pointing an older redsn0w at the beta7 IPSW, there’s no need to re-run the full jailbreak step again…just use this newer one to make the tethered boot easier 🙂
* Update #11a: We’ve replaced the Windows version of 0.9.9b3 with 0.9.9b3a.  The new version fixes a caching bug that affected only Windows users — point it one more time at your iOS5GM IPSW, and from then on you won’t have to point at it again.
* As a special bonus to Windows users, we’ve made it so that if you make a copy of redsn0w.exe and name it something like “justboot.exe” (anything with the word “boot” in it), it will start up in “Just Boot tethered” mode. That way you don’t have to click on any buttons at all to boot tethered! :)”
* As always, you can download RedSn0w from our downloads section. Not sure how to use RedSn0w, check out our dedicated RedSn0w jailbreak page, or watch our video tutorial.
