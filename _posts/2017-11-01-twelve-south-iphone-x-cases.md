* Today is a big day for folks over at premium Apple accessory maker Twelve South, who announced they’ve optimized their best-selling iPhone cases for the iPhone X form factor.
* “This is a huge step for our little company and we are thrilled to be a part of the story this early in the game,” West Cerrudo, Twelve South’s Director of Marketing, tells me via email.
* Some of the best iPhone cases from Twelve South, including their BookBook (vintage leather case and wallet), RelaxedLeather (burnished leather case) and Journal (all leather wallet case), now support Apple’s upcoming OLED phone.
* They are available to preorder starting today.
