* By following a few simple steps laid out in this tutorial, you will learn how to access not just a list of tracks you recently enjoyed on Apple Music, but also those heard on Beats 1 Radio and other radio stations.
* Before we get to it, let me quickly get you up to speed on play history.
* For starters, your play history captures the following:
* Unfortunately, the list of songs heard on Beats 1 Radio and Apple Music radio stations is stored separately from the history of tracks played from your personal music collection and those you listen to on Apple Music.
* To see the songs that you streamed via Apple Music or played from the personal music library on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, follow the steps outlined below:
* Step 1: Launch the Music app on your iOS device.
* Step 2: Scroll down a bit until you see the Recently Played section. Tap the See All button next to the header.
* Unfortunately, this screen might not show every single song you have played, but will instead only show covers for albums, radio stations or playlists you have listened to. This is very limited indeed, but your recently listened music history is not all gone. It can easily be found on a Mac.
* To see the songs, playlists, radio stations, or playlists that you streamed via Apple Music or played from the personal music library on your Mac or iPhone, follow the steps outlined below:
* Step 1: Open iTunes on your Mac or Windows PC.
* Step 2: Click the List icon located to the left of the search field. In the drop-down menu, make sure the History tab is selected.

* There you go—now you can browse the songs, playlists and albums you recently listened to on Apple Music or played from your personal library.
* As you can see on the above screenshot, your play history is divided by various sections, showing where this song came from. Not only can you see songs you have listened to on your iPhone or iPad, but it also tells you what playlist or radio station these songs were from. Very handy!
* You can delete play history on this Mac by clicking the Clear button.
