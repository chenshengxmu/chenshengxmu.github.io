* The Dropbox-owned Mailbox app received a major update today, bringing the email client to version 1.7. The update adds a highly-anticipated feature: support for other email services like Yahoo, iCloud, and others.
* Up until now, the popular Mailbox app only supported Gmail accounts. But with today’s release, users can now use the app to access and manage their Inboxes from Yahoo Mail, and various Apple email extensions…
* Here’s the full 1.7 change log:
* – Support for iCloud and Yahoo email accounts – Background syncing – Option to disable “help me get to zero” banner – Option to disable swipe to open drawer – Bug fixes and UX improvements
* And the announcement from Dropbox:
* “Today we’re thrilled to announce we’ve added Mailbox support for Yahoo, iCloud, me.com, and mac.com email accounts. This is a big step for us — we get more requests for Yahoo and iCloud support than for any other feature. 
* Mailbox remains 100% free, and adding a Yahoo or iCloud email account is just as easy as adding a Gmail account.”
* If you don’t have it yet, the latest version of Dropbox is available in the App Store, for both the iPhone and the iPad, for free.
