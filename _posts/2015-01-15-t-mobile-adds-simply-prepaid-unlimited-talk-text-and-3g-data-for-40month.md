* T-Mobile announced on Thursday a new prepaid plan titled Simply Prepaid that delivers unlimited 2G data, talk and text for $40 per month – along with 1GB of LTE. Like all of T-Mobile’s plans, the number four wireless carrier doesn’t require a contract – just a smartphone with a capable SIM-card.
* For customers that want to upgrade their plan with 4G connectivity for some added speed, T-Mobile will charge $50 per month for unlimited data, talk and text and up to 3GB of 4G LTE or $60 per month for unlimited data, talk and text and up to 5GB of 4G LTE.
* If you see yourself being connected to Wi-Fi often, the $40 unlimited plan seems like one heck of a deal. Simply Prepaid plans will include Wi-Fi calling at no additional cost and up to 8 Mbps speeds.
* “There’s a reason the Un-carrier continues to be #1 in prepaid, and it starts with our willingness to break the rules and give customers better choices,” John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile, said. “We will never stop eliminating customer pain points. The 1.2 million net new prepaid customers who joined T-Mobile last year already see that value, and we have no plans to stop there.”
* The new Simply Prepaid plan will be available online and in T-Mobile retail stores, Simply Prepaid dealer locations, and all other authorized retailers starting January 25th.
* In August, T-Mobile moved away from a tiered prepaid approach and simplified it. If you don’t like the new plan offered Thursday, T-Mobile offers prepaid plans for as low as $10 per month. After a $3 monthly minimum charge that includes 30 minutes, a single minute or text message costs $.10. If you’d like data, $5 gets you a one-day pass with 500MB. There’s a $10 option for a seven-day pass with 1GB of LTE-eligible data as well.
* Update: A previous version of this article said the plan uses 3G data, not 2G.
