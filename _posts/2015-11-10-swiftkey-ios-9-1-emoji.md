* All those burritos, tacos, middle fingers and other emoji characters enabled by the iOS 9.1 software update are now available on SwiftKey’s keyboard for your iPhone, iPod touch and iPad.
* The latest update to SwiftKey’s free of charge keyboard in the App Store essentially adds all of the new iOS 9.1 emoji, including the unicorn, many new facial expressions and gestures (yes, the middle finger, too) and a man in a business suit levitating.
* Some of the other newly added emoji include:
* All told, there are over 180 new emoji to enjoy in this SwiftKey update.
* That’s because SwiftKey recently joined the Unicode Consortium, the organization that makes decisions about which emoji come to your devices.
* The arrival of full emoji support in the SwiftKey keyboard enhances the software’s already robust set of emoji features, such as a feature that predicts the emoji you’re most likely to use next and Emoji Insights, stats that tell you which emoji you use more than anyone else, to name a few.
* SwiftKey requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with iOS 8.0 or later. The app is localized in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.
* Grab SwiftKey Keyboard for free in the App Store.
