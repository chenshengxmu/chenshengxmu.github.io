* Today, iHome announced the latest edition to their smart home lineup, dubbed the iSP100 SmartPlug, just in time as people start decorating their homes for the holidays.
* The new SmartPlug connects to your Wi-Fi network and lets you easily control devices like Christmas lights without significant lag that plagues Bluetooth-based HomeKit devices. In addition to supporting Apple’s HomeKit framework for the connected home, the accessory works with Nest, Google Assistant, Wink and Amazon Alexa as well.
* The plug is able to handle up to 1800W of power.
* The only other HomeKit-equipped outdoor smart outlet would be the iDevices outdoor switch, which is considerably more expensive. However, the iDevices switch actually has two outlets versus the sole socket on the iHome.
* iHome also unveiled a Wi-Fi-equipped motion sensor, a leak sensor and a helpful door and window sensor. None of these products however support HomeKit, at least not yet.
* The biggest benefits of Wi-Fi-connected outlets like this is improved performance (no Bluetooth lag), the fact they don’t require a hub to function and the ability to easily control them with the Home app, via Siri or through any of the other smart home platforms they support.
* The new SmartPlus is currently available to order from Amazon, for $39.99, if you’re interested in picking up one (or two) before the holidays.
