* If you’ve ever wondered what Apple called its various releases of iOS when building them internally, then you’re in luck. Developer and general internet fiend Steve Troughton-Smith has shared the internal code names Apple gave to all of its iOS version, starting way back at iOS 1.0.
* While these names may not have the sugary goodness that Google’s Android builds posses, it is still interesting to see the code names out in the wild, while also perhaps getting an answer as to why Apple gave iOS the default login password all jailbreakers have come to rely on…
* First, here’s the full rundown of all the iOS internal code names beginning at iOS 1.0 and ending all the way at iOS 5.1.
* If you cast your gaze to the first name on that list, you will notice that iOS 1.0 was given the name “Alpine” by Apple’s engineers. If you’re of the jailbreaking persuasion then you may also know that the default password for every iPhone when connecting over SSH is, you guessed it, “alpine.”
* Coincidence? Probably not. And while ultimately this doesn’t tell us anything useful, it’s still pretty interesting!
