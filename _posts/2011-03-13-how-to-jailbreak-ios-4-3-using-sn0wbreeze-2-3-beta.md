* If you are one of the unlucky ones who upgraded to Apple’s new 4.3 and lost their jailbreak, listen up. Although i0n1c said he would be waiting for iOS 4.3.1 to come out, to release a jailbreak, iH8sn0w has decided to give us Sn0wbreeze 2.3 beta to tide us over.
* So if you have an iPhone 4, 3GS, iPad or iP0d touch and are running 4.3, let me give you a simple tutorial on how to jailbreak with Sn0wbreeze…
* Remember this is a beta, there are dangers to upgrading to 4.3 if you haven’t already. The mobile substrate conflict we mentioned here is not corrected. And this IS a tethered jailbreak, you will need your computer every time you reboot for it to work. Finally there is no unlock for iOS 4.3, so if you are counting on that, we don’t recommend updating to 4.3.
* This jailbreak is for WINDOWS users only, that’s the only OS Sn0wbreeze supports. Also, this will not work on the iPad 2.
* Step 1: Make sure you have all the necessary softwares. Your iTunes needs to be up to date with 10.2.1. You need the .ipsw file of iOS 4.3 which you can get here, just select your device. Make sure to note where it downloads to.
* Step 2: Next you are going to need Sn0wbreeze 2.3 Beta for Windows, which also includes iBooty 2.0 that we will use later. I recommend putting everything in a folder on your desktop to help keep organized.
* Step 3: Boot up Sn0wbreeze and click the blue arrow in the bottom right of the application. Next you will choose that firmware .ipsw file you downloaded earlier by clicking “Browse”, and selecting the file from your hard drive.

* Step 4: Once it’s done verifying your firmware, click next. Select ‘Expert Mode’ and then the ‘Build IPSW’ option. Don’t worry, building .ipsw files can take a while, they are close to 700MB!

* Step 5: Once it says ‘Done!’, press ok. The following screen will, you guessed it, help you put your iDevice in DFU mode.
* – Hold the power and Home buttons for 10 seconds
* – Release the Power button while still holding the Home button for 10 more seconds and… Success!
* Step 6: If you have done things correctly to this point,  Sn0wbreeze tells you to launch iTunes with your iPhone plugged in.
* Step 7: Navigate to your iDevice in iTunes and hold left shift + click ‘Restore’, this should launch a browser window for you to select the custom IPSW Sn0wbreeze built for you. Select it and let iTunes restore it, this can take some time as well.

* Step 8: iBooty should have been extracted to your desktop after Sn0wbreeze was done. We will be using iBooty to boot your iDevice into a tethered jailbreak. Load iBooty up and select your device from the dropdown. Now hit ‘Start’ and you will once again be walked through the DFU mode process.

* Step 9: As soon as you are successfully in DFU mode, iBooty will take care of the rest. After it’s finished, your iPod touch will be booted into jailbreak mode!
