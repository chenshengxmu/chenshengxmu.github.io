* Just ten days ago, Electronic Arts announced PopCap’s hotly anticipated Plants vs Zombies sequel topped sixteen million download since its August 16 App Store debut. Today, the super publisher shared another milestone: players have now downloaded Plants vs Zombies 2 twenty-five million times. That’s nine million downloads in just ten days, averaging to a download rate of nearly a million copies per day…
* EA wrote in a blog post that downloads for Plants vs. Zombies 2 have exceeded total lifetime downloads for the original Plants vs. Zombies game.
* That’s hardly a fair comparison: the original game debuted as a paid download with wildly fluctuating price points whereas Plants vs Zombies 2 is free-to-play with in-app purchases, which has quickly become a thing for Electronic Arts.
* Be that as it may, Plants vs Zombies 2 downloads will no doubt explode after EA releases the game on Windows 8, Windows Phone 8 and Android platforms “later this year and beyond”.
* According to a recent Jostiq story, a major ‘Far Future’ content update is coming soon.
* The publisher released the following infographic highlighting key milestones.

* Plants vs Zombies was a staggered roll-out: Electronic Arts initially launched the game on the Australia and New Zealand App Store on July 9, before making it available worldwide mid-August.
* Plants vs Zombies 2 is free on the App Store.
* In just five days, it emerged as the top iPhone and iPad game on the App Store in 137 countries worldwide and at post time had ranking of 4.5/5 stars.
