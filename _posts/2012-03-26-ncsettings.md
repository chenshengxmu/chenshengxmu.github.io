* NCSettings is a free jailbreak tweak that adds an SBSettings inspired set of toggles to iOS 5’s Notification Center.
* While the description of the tweak may sound run of the mill, it’s a beautiful looking widget that has a nifty trick up its sleeve.
* Check out our full video walkthrough of NCSettings inside…
* The awesome thing about NCSettings is that you can tap and hold on any of the toggles to put them into “wiggle mode”. Doing this allows you to rearrange the toggle icons in an order that you see fit.
* There’s also a settings panel included that lets you outright disable and enable various toggles as well.
* Overall, NCSettings is a very beautiful and well functioning jailbreak widget that simply needs to be tried.
* You can get it for free on Cydia’s ModMyi repo, so what are you waiting for?
