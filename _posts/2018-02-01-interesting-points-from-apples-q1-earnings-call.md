* Apple this afternoon announced the financial results for its fiscal first quarter of 2018, and the numbers for the 3-month are good but not great. The company beat EPS and revenue expectations, but fell short in iPhone sales.
* Following the release of its earnings report, CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri hopped on a conference call to talk about Apple’s performance. And as usual, we’ve rounded up some of the more interesting points from the call.
* Despite missing on iPhone sales, at the time of writing, Apple’s stock was up 4% in after-hours trading. If you want to listen to today’s earnings call, a replay will be available here for a limited time.
