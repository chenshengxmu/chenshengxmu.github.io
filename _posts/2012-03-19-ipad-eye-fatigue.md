* The biggest change in Apple’s new iPad is undoubtedly that Retina display. Cramming all those extra pixels into the same size screen is certainly a feat of engineering, but Apple didn’t do it just because it can.
* As anyone with a new iPad in front of them, or an iPhone 4/4S for that matter, will have to admit, having a Retina display makes the screen almost look like a magazine. It’s impossible sharp, mesmerisingly clear.
* According to one Optometrist and the editor of All About Vision, those extra pixels also help to reduce eye strain, too…
* “A key factor in something that’s called computer vision syndrome, or just eye strain from computer use, is screen resolution. The new iPad, with twice the resolution of the iPad 2, 264 ppi (pixels per inch) instead of 132, people are going to notice less pixelation, especially in a small typeface. It’s not just an enjoyment issue or an aesthetic issue, but it’s definitely a visual comfort isue, over time.”
* Until now, iPads have been pushed down the e-reading pecking order by the Kindle, Amazon’s own e-reader. The ace up the Kindle’s sleeve is its e-ink display which, because it is not backlit, causes minimal eye fatigue. The new iPad may now be set to give the Kindle a run for its money.
* We’d love to know how people are using their new iPads. Are you reading books on yours, or are you still going to use a Kindle or other e-reader as your main paper book replacing tech?
