* Raise to Wake is one of my favorite features to ship with some of some of Apple’s latest handsets, but it isn’t available on the iPhone 6 or earlier.
* You can change that with a new free jailbreak tweak called Wake It Up, which ports the Raise to Wake feature to unsupported iPhones.
* After you install Wake It Up, you’ll need to calibrate it. After you do, you should be able to lift your iPhone up off the table and unlock it with ease.
* You can read our full review of Wake It Up to learn more about why it’s such a great tweak to have.
* ByeClocknDate11: Lets you hide the Clock and Date from the Lock screen (free via CydiaGeek’s beta repository)
* CaptchaCatcher: Automatically captures and inputs captchas from SMS messages (free via BigBoss repository)
* customReturnKey: Customize the text that appears on your keyboard’s Return key (free via BigBoss repository)
* For The Modern: An animated icon theme based off of the Fingal framework (free via BigBoss repository)
* MoreLinesNotifications: Increases the amount of lines of text a notification can display on the Lock screen and in Notification Center (free via BigBoss repository – review)
* TwitterFullScreen: Brings full-screen support to the official Twitter app (free via CydiaGeek’s repository)
* Most of these tweaks were made with iOS 10 or earlier in mind. That said, many developers are prepping tweaks for iOS 11 since Saurik said he’d be updating Cydia and Mobile Substrate for iOS 11.
* If you’re looking for more tweaks to try, then consider adding third-party Cydia repositories to your device to expand your scope and check out last week’s jailbreak tweak roundup just in case you missed anything special. We also have a plethora of dedicated roundups that can help you find new tweaks for tweaking your jailbroken iOS 10 device below:
