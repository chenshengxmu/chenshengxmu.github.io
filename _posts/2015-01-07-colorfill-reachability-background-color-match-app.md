* Tired of the dark Reachability background color? Looking for something that matches the look and feel of the app you’re currently using? You may want to open Cydia and download a new jailbreak tweak called ColorFill. It purposes to color the empty Reachability view space with colors based on the dominant hue of the current screen.
* Using ColorFill means that if you’re using an app that’s dominated by the color blue, your Reachability view will contain a blue hue. The color of the Reachability view will largely be influenced by the color of the current app.

* Once you install ColorFill, you’ll find a single switch in the root of the stock Settings app for activating the tweak. You can toggle ColorFill on or off without needing a respring.
* Since I find that many apps stick with drab neutral gray colors, your likely to find that most apps result in a boring Reachability view. But every so often, you’ll find an app with a daring color scheme, and the Reachability view compliments that color scheme accordingly.

* If you’d like to give your Reachability view some much-needed variety, then try ColorFill. You’ll find it free of charge on Cydia.
