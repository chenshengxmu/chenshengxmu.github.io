* Since the dawn of the iPhone, there have been arguments about whether you should protect your iPhone with a case or leave it completely uncovered to show off its beautiful design. What if there was a way to have the best of both worlds? Well, there is.
* Bumpies Minimalist Corner Case is not a case at all. It is actually four small griping pieces of shock-absorbing material that stick to the corners of your iPhone 6, leaving the rest of the beautifully designed smartphone completely naked.
* Bumpies are made from sturdy, impact resistant material. They act like a shock absorbing bumper case without the extra case. The tiny corner pieces extend beyond the iPhone edge about 1.25mm, so all sides are protected from touching flat surfaces when dropped.
* The corners adhere to your iPhone 6 using 3M-style tape. Once they are installed, they wonâ€™t come off very easy thanks to the adhesive. They are also small enough that they will work with many other accessories, like armbands, dashboard mounts, and screen protectors. The corners are contoured and low-profile to be less likely to catch on things when you pull your iPhone out of a pocket or bag.
* Bumpies come in a variety of colors, but strangely, not clear. You can buy them for $25 on Amazon. There is a version compatible with the iPhone 6 Plus for the same price.
