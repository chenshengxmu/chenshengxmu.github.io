* I love Spotify and I don’t think that’s a secret. So can you imagine how happy I was when I stumbled upon this new jailbreak tweak in Cydia?
* SpotiSearch is a brand new tweak that allows you to search the entire Spotify library using Spotlight search. That’s right, you can search for your favorite artists, albums or songs directly from the same Spotlight search that you use to search your local iPhone.
* I’ve taken SpotiSearch for a thorough test-drive on video. Join me inside, as I showcase how this awesome new jailbreak tweak works.
* Once you install SpotiSearch, you can configure its settings via the stock Settings app. SpotiSearch’s preferences contain settings for your local region, and select track action—which can play a radio station, or play the track directly (premium Spotify iPhone customers only). There are also result limits, which can individually limit the amount of albums, artists, or tracks returned via a search.

* The great thing about SpotiSearch is that the search is fairly instant and it happens natively within iOS’ Spotlight interface. You don’t even have to launch the Spotify app to start searching the entire Spotify library.

* If you’re a Spotify user and you’re jailbroken, then I highly recommend SpotiSearch. It’s a quick and easy way to incorporate Spotify searches directly into native Spotlight, and it doesn’t hinder any of the normal Spotlight functionality. You can still rearrange and order the Spotlight search categories, including the new categories for Spotify track, artist, and album search.

* SpotiSearch is $0.99 on Cydia’s BigBoss repo, and comes with a recommendation from this hardcore Spotify user and fan. If you decide to give it a try, then please share your experience with the tweak down below in the comments.
