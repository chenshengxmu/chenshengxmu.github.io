title: Remove Background Toggle for SBSettings

* Remove Background is a new mod available in Cydia that adds a toggle to SBSettings allowing you to remove all apps from the task switcher, and kill apps processes at the same time. It’s pretty handy because your app switcher can get messy really quickly if you recently opened several applications
* I’ve been looking for a similar app for a while and although Remove Background works as advertised, I find it to be too “extreme” for me. I rarely (if ever) want to kill all apps at once. Instead, I’d like to be able to select in the settings what apps I never want to run in the background or appear in the task switcher. If you’re a developer, feel free to use my idea…
* What about you? Have you used Remove Background? What do you think about it?
