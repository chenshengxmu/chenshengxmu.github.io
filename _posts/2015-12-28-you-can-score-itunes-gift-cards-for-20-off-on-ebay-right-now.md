* Who wants free money? If you do, know there is currently a limited amount of iTunes gift card on eBay available at a 20% discount, effectively giving you free money. As of writing, you can score a $100 iTunes gift card for only $80. If you’re interested, act fast because these deals won’t last long.
* These are physical gift cards shipped to you. I personally ordered two gift cards from this merchant earlier this month and both cards were delivered in 7 days.
* The credit you receive will be added to your iTunes account and will then be available to use immediately to purchase apps, books, movies, music from iTunes. Even better, if you have an Apple Music subscription, you can use that money towards the cost of your monthly membership.
* Although it can seem shady at first look, these gift cards are legit. I have purchased these in the past, so I can personally guarantee it’s a safe purchase. Again, this is free money, so there is no reason not to take it. Hurry!
* Note this deal is only available in the US.
