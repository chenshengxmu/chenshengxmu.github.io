* To this date, we’ve seen a number of supposed dummy units, purported front and back panels, cases, batteries, manufacturing molds, technical drawings, volume buttons and numerous other alleged iPhone 6 parts.
* Today, we show you another interesting leak. Coming straight via a post on Weibo (China’s version of Twitter), it’s a supposed screen backlight part. The part measures 4.7-inches diagonally and for the most part resembles its iPhone 5s/5c counterpart…
* The images of the purported iPhone 6 backlight panel part seen top of post and below were first spotted in a Weibo post and republished by the French blog NowhereElse.fr [Google translate].
* The top image shows the difference between the alleged 4.7-inch iPhone 6 backlight panel (left) and the four-inch part currently used in the iPhone 5s (right). Photographed below: the said part in the poster’s hand (left) and multiple 4.7-inch backlight modules.
* These parts are commonly used in mobile devices with displays that require backlight, such as iPhones and iPads that use LCD IPS screen technology (unlike Samsung’s mostly AMOLED devices).

* Take the shots with a few pinches of salt.
* As NowhereElse editor Steve Hemmerstoffer notes, he couldn’t vouch for their authenticity because he absolutely couldn’t establish the reliability of the source.
* The scuttlebutt is that Apple will release the next iPhone in larger sizes, one measuring 4.7-inches and the other filing as a 5.5-inch tablet.
* Of course, Apple could also choose to keep the current four-inch smartphones (the iPhone 5/5s/5c) on the market – or even refresh them with better hardware – to make the inevitable form-factor transition easier on app developers.
* Apple is believed to have shrank the thickness of the iPhone 6 down to 6mm or 7mm, dependent on whether or not its engineers are cool with a protruding lens on the back.
* Various sources have indicated that the handset’s slimmer body has been realized by switching to thinner LED backlights and possibly using a lighter device frame.
