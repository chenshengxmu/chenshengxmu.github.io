* It’s official. T-Mobile has overtaken Sprint to become the third largest carrier in the United States. During its earnings call on Tuesday, Sprint told investors that it ended its most recent quarter, which ended in June, with 56.8 million customers.
* That falls just shy of the 58.9 million subscribers T-Mobile finished with in its most recent quarter, which also ended in June, officially moving the Magenta-colored company into the third largest US carrier spot, behind AT&T and Verizon Wireless.
* Now that it’s official, how about we focus on why @TMobile is succeeding? Hint: Listening to customers!! http://t.co/VVq7ut5hFB

* Much of T-Mobile’s meteoric rise can be attributed to CEO John Legere and his “uncarrier” campaign, which features unorthodox policy changes and promotions. When Legere joined in 2012, T-Mobile had 33 million subscribers; Sprint had 55 million.
* Despite falling to the number four spot, Sprint touted its latest quarter as a successful one. In a press release, CEO Marcelo Claure said that the company has made “meaningful progress” in its turnaround plan by “enhancing its overall value proposition.”
