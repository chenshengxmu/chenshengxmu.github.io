* Facebook is announcing today a brand new feature called Music Stories, basically a new post format for Facebook that should make it easier to discover and share music from Spotify and Apple Music.
* Now every time you share songs or albums shared from Spotify or Apple Music using Facebook’s iPhone application, these links will automatically get turned into the new post format which lets others listen to 30-second previews while on Facebook.
* It’s interesting that these previews are directly streamed from either Apple Music or Spotify, and can be purchased from or saved to the respective music streaming service.
* “The previews from Apple Music and iTunes are available directly through Facebook,” noted the social networking behemoth. Clicking a Music Story based on an Apple Music link will launch the full track in Apple Music, where it can be easily added to a subscriber’s music library.
* We’re introducing “Music Stories” today to enable better music discovery and sharing on Facebook. The new post format allows people to listen to previews on Facebook from Apple Music and Spotify. You can read more about it on Facebook for Media: http://media.fb.com/blog

* The previews from Spotify are also available directly through Facebook. And like Apple Music previews, clicking Spotify previews takes you to Spotify’s Facebook app to stream the full track or add it to your playlist library, without ever leaving Facebook.
* Beyond Apple Music and Spotify, Facebook has pledged to expand Music Story support for additional streaming music services soon.
