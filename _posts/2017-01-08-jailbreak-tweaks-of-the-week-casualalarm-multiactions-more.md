* This week wasn’t quite as busy in terms of jailbreak tweak releases as the last was, but it’s still a lot higher than it has been these last several months without a stable public jailbreak for the latest iOS firmware versions.
* In this roundup, we’ll talk about all the jailbreak tweaks that were launched throughout this past week. We’ll start with our favorites and move on to the rest afterwards.
* CasualAlarm – FREE

* CasualAlarm is a free jailbreak tweak that lets your iPhone play a completely random song from your local music whenever your alarm goes off.
* Because it works at random, you’ll always be pleasantly surprised to a completely different song every time it goes off, no matter how many alarms you’ve set. You will no longer need to set up different alarms throughout the week with different songs for each.

* MultiActions – $1.49

* MultiActions is a new jailbreak tweak that lets you perform bulk actions for multiple app icons on your Home screen or inside folders at once.
* It’s key points are making a folder out of multiple app icons on your Home screen, moving multiple apps out of a folder and back to the Home screen, and deleting multiple apps from your device at one time.
* With an intelligent UI that appears at the bottom of the screen, as well as an app icon counter, it’s easy to use and can be very convenient for those of you that have lots of apps.
