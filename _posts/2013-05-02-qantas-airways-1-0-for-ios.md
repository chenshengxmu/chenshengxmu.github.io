* Australia’s airline Qantas said back in November it would enable Passbook integration for boarding passes for domestic flights. In the meantime, Qantas partner American Airlines rolled out support for Passbook boarding passes, as did a bunch of major airlines around the world. Making good on its promise, Qantas yesterday finally released its own iOS app with Passbook integration for digital boarding passes, mobile check-ins, real-time flight changes and frequent flyers…
* Other features include the ability to book flights directly in the app, which could save lots of time if you’re planning on flying with Qantas. On top of that, the Qantas Airways app allows you to search and book over 100,000 hotels worldwide, check the latest flight stats and more.
