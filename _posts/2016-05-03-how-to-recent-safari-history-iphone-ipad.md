* On any given day, I browse the web a lot—be it catching up on the news, doing research on future stories or skimming through my favorites to learn what’s the latest. And more often than not do I find myself struggling to make my way back to an article I stumbled upon a few hours ago.
* Locating a specific item in browsing history can feel like finding a needle in the haystack, especially if you’re on the go.
* Yes, I could just tap Safari’s back button multiple times or swipe to go back a single webpage at a time until I found the webpage I was looking for, but that’s a time-consuming process which unnecessarily wastes my iPhone’s cellular data.
* As you’ll discover in this tutorial, Safari provides a very handy, though not immediately obvious shortcut which allows you to quickly jump to any previously visited webpage.
* 1) Launch Safari on your iOS device.
* 2) Tap and hold Safari’s back arrow button at the bottom left.
* This will bring up a menu with the history list of webpages you viewed recently.

* 3) Tap any entry in your history to jump to that webpage.
* Tip: Long-tapping Safari’s forward arrow button will also pull up the history list provided you jumped back to a recently visited webpage beforehand.
* Keep in mind that the webpages you see in the list represent only that specific tab’s history. Since you’re unlikely to visit hundreds of webpages through a single Safari tab, your tab-specific history won’t be too long, making it easier to visually spot a recently visited webpage in the list.
* If you want to access a history for another Safari tab, first switch to that tab and then long-tap the back/forward button.
* This convenient shortcut works in Safari for Mac, too.
