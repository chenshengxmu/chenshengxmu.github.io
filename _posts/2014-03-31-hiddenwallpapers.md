* Do you enjoy using iOS 7’s dynamic wallpaper feature? Would you like to get your hands on five additional wallpapers? If the answer to those questions was yes, then you definitely need to check out this jailbreak tweak.
* HiddenWallpapers is a jailbreak tweak that’s available free on Cydia, and it unlocks five additional dynamic wallpapers for your iOS 7 device. Three of the wallpapers are admittedly a bit pedestrian, but there are two that I think are quite special. Have a look at our video after the break to see the new wallpapers in action.
* Once you install HiddenWallpapers, go to Settings > Wallpapers & Brightness and select Dynamic wallpaper. Scroll to the bottom of the list of dynamic wallpaper to find the five additional wallpapers.

* The first three additional wallpapers are fairly average, but the last two make the tweak worth downloading. There’s a deep-red wallpaper and an even cooler dark dynamic wallpaper with different colored bubbles. The dark wallpaper is without a doubt the coolest looking dynamic wallpaper available, and I highly recommend you try it out for yourself.
* It should be mentioned that HiddenWallpapers doesn’t require WinterBoard in order to work. Just install it, go to you wallpaper settings and enjoy your five new dynamic wallpapers.
* HiddenWallpapers is free of charge on Cydia’s BigBoss repo. Download it today, and let us know what you think about it in the comments below.
