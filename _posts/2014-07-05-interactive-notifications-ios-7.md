title: How to get iOS 8 style quick reply on iOS 7

* If someone told you that six months ago that quick reply for Messages would be a feature in iOS 8, most people would probably say that it would be the headline feature for the updated OS. But Apple cranked it up a few notches, unveiling new features like Continuity and extensions, and suddenly quick reply no longer seemed like that big of a deal.
* But let’s face it, quick reply is still very much a big deal. In fact, it’s such a wanted feature that there have been tons of jailbreak tweaks in the past that have brought some form of quick reply to the table for jailbroken users.
* The latest such tweak aims to mimic the quick reply style found in iOS 8 to a close degree. Have a look at our video walkthrough past the break to see Interactive Message Notifications in action.
* Once you install Interactive Message Notifications, you can begin using it immediately. In fact, there are no options to configure for the tweak whatsoever.
* To use Interactive Message Notifications, swipe down on an incoming banner notification to display a quick reply option that looks strikingly similar to the interface contained within iOS 8.
* Interactive Message Notifications is serviceable, but if you’re going to add quick reply functionality by means of a jailbreak tweak, I’d definitely recommend checking out some of the better options out there. Auki, and Sebastien’s favorite, biteSMS, quickly come to mind.
* If you’re interested in taking this tweak for a spin, then head over to the BigBoss repo where it can be purchased for $0.99. What do you think?
